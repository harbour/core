  <h2><a name="32"></a>3.12. I've got loads of Clipper code I can donate, what shall I do?</h2>
<p>Harbour isn't a project to create a repository of free Clipper code so,
unless your code directly implements a core Clipper run-time library
function it probably isn't a lot of use to Harbour.</p>
<p>However, don't let your code go to waste, why not consider starting a
non-compiler specific but cross-platform free software Clipper library that
will benefit programmers using any of the
<a href="harbour56.html#ClipperCompilers">Clipper compiler implementations</a>?</p>
