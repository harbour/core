  <h2><a name="24"></a>3.4. Where can I find the source?</h2>
<p>There are three methods of getting the source for harbour, which method you
use will depend on how up-to-date you feel you need to be.
<ul>
<li>The unstable snapshot
<p>A snapshot of the source is made available on the
<a href="/download.htm">Harbour project download web page</a>. Please be aware that this is an <b>unstable</b>
snapshot. Using this source could make all sorts of horrible things happen
- it might not even compile. You have been warned.</p>

</li>
<li>The stable snapshot
<p>Once in a while a stable snapshot of the Harbour source is made available
from the <a href="/download.htm">download page</a>
of the <a href="/">Harbour project web site</a>.
These snapshots are referred to as
&quot;releases&quot; and are considered stable in that the source will
compile and there are no known showstoppers in the compiler, virtual machine
or run-time library.</p>
<p>If you like to play with alpha quality software but want to feel safe doing
so then a stable release is for you.</p>

</li>
<li>Direct CVS access
<p>The best and most direct method of getting Harbour source is from the CVS
server. This is where the
<a href="harbour9.html#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a>
work on the source for Harbour (actually, they all work on their own
machines, this server gives them, in effect, a virtual shared directory).</p>
<p>If you intend to work with Harbour built from the CVS itself you should
really consider subscribing to the
<a href="harbour35.html#DevMailList">developer's mailing list</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Please note that if you do want to help develop Harbour then the last option
is the best option (and, in the long term, the only useful option for all
concerned).</p>
