  <h2><a name="48"></a>6.4. What advantages do other Clipper compilers have over Harbour?</h2>
<p>Currently the advantages
<a href="harbour56.html#ClipperCompilers">other Clipper compilers</a> have over Harbour are:
<ul>
<li>They are available and working (for various values of &quot;working&quot;).</li>
<li>They are supported.</li>
<li>They are documented.</li>
<li>They, to some degree, give you
<a href="harbour11.html#Warranty">someone to blame</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>As time passes most of the above advantages will be eroded. Note that the
documentation process is well under way and that support is simply a
<a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a> post away.
The only advantage that won't be eroded is the last one in the list.</p>
<p>I'm sure that users of
<a href="harbour56.html#ClipperCompilers">other compilers</a>,
not to mention their authors, feel they have other advantages too. This is
fine. Harbour isn't an exercise in removing or replacing those compilers,
Harbour is an effort to complement the
<a href="harbour56.html#ClipperCompilers">list of Clipper compilers</a> with a
<a href="harbour13.html#FreeSoftware">free software</a>
offering.</p>
