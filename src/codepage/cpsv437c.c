/* NOTE: The collation sequence below is almost compatible with Clipper's
   NTXSWE.OBJ which does NOT provide a correct Swedish collation. The most
   notable error in NTXSWE.OBJ is the uppercase E with an acute accent
   versus the lowercase e with a grave accent. All other accented characters
   are ignored and show up according to their ASCII values. Another oddity
   in NTXSWE.OBJ is that the Danish "AE" and "ae" compound characters
   (ASCII values 146 and 145 respectively) turn up between ASCII 135 and
   136, a rather pointless relocation IMHO. I found no way to replicate
   that behaviour in the character strings below, so if you allow Chr( 146 )
   and Chr( 145 ) to be saved in indexed fields there WILL be index corruption
   if data is shared between Clipper and Harbour. Upper()/Lower() converson
   of those characters as well as all accented characters must be done
   programatically just like in Clipper.

   For sharing data with Clipper, assuming that the Chr( 146 ) and Chr( 145 )
   problem is properly taken care of in your code, this codepage version
   must be used. For correct collation according to the book "Svenska
   skrivregler" (Swedish Writing Rules) by Svenska Språknämnden (the Swedish
   Language Council), use the SV850 version instead. That will of course
   not be Clipper compatible.
 */

/* NOTE2: due to above conditions human readable form of SVCLIP definition
          has been replaced with binary tables generated by tests/cpinfo.prg
          compiled by Clipper and linked with NTXSWE.OBJ so now SVCLIP is
          _fully_ Clipper compatible and should be used when data is shared
          between Clipper and Harbour applications.
