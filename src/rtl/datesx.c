/* NOTE: This function is a non-CA-Cl*pper function implemented
         in the original CA-Cl*pper namespace. This should have
         been marked as HB_COMPAT_*, but it's not, as it's a
         well-known name with similar functionality under most
         Clipper dialects and libraries. (differences may exist
         though, like behaviour for non-string, empty or
         no-parameter scenarios.
         Nevertheless this function must be kept in a separate
         source file to avoid linking errors when a 3rd party
         library would also define this function. [vszakats] */
