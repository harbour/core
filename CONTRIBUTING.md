# How to Participate

- You can give feedback/suggestions by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/vszakats/harbour-core/issues/new).
- Submit a patch:
  1. Fork the repository
  2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my_mod`
  3. Do commit pre-check and new log entry: `hbrun bin/commit`
  4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am "Added my feature"`
  5. Push to the branch: `git push origin my_mod`
  6. Open a Pull Request
- Make sure to use the same coding/formatting style as you find in
  the files you're modifying. The easiest way to achieve this
  is to use these commands to format the sources (use this
  with care - most existing sources are well-formatted, so make
  sure to only apply it to newly added or modified code sections)

        $ uncrustify -c <harbour-dir>/bin/harbour.ucf <source{.c|.h}>
        $ <harbour-dir>/bin/hbformat <source{.prg|.hb|.ch}>

- Text editor setting for Harbour files
  - Encoding is either 7-bit ASCII or UTF-8, without [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)
  - Use spaces, never tabs
  - Remove trailing spaces from lines
  - Keep one (not zero or multiple) newline at the end of file
  - Use platform native newline (CRLF or LF)
- In the rare case you need to send something large (> 100KB),
  use this [free service](https://transfer.sh).
- See this good guideline on how to contribute:

# Troubleshooting

Evaluate these points before reporting an issue:

1.  <a name="trbl-1"></a> Make sure to have carefully read this document.
2.  <a name="trbl-2"></a> Make sure to do a `make clean` before doing
    a build after refreshing the sources.
3.  <a name="trbl-3"></a> If that still fails, make sure to install fresh
    source tree in a new local directory and start over. See
    [How to Get](README.md#how-to-get) for instructions to get the source.
    In case you installed Harbour into system locations (this used to be
    the case with some \*nix users, albeit mostly completely unnecessarily
    or wrongly - f.e. for unstable versions), you will need to remember
    cleaning off Harbour from all of these locations, too.
    Hint: Never install unstable Harbour versions to system locations.
4.  <a name="trbl-4"></a> If you are doing a cross-build, make sure to
    have rebuilt the native Harbour executables for your host platform.
    See `HB_HOST_BIN` build messages to find their location.
5.  <a name="trbl-5"></a> Keep your `PATH` clean from old, mixed compiler
    tools or other Harbour versions when building Harbour. The surest way
    to achieve this is to leave only the C compiler directory in `PATH`:

        set PATH=C:\<c-compiler-bin-dir>

    > If you use Harbour official binary distro on Windows, even above is
    > unnecessary and should be avoided.
6.  <a name="trbl-6"></a> Remove all old, unnecessary environment variables
    (for both Harbour and C compiler) from your environment. Also remove
    any custom settings for your C compiler.
    Use only those documented in this file.
7.  <a name="trbl-7"></a> Remove any Harbour build settings documented in
    [Build Options](README.md#build-options).
8.  <a name="trbl-8"></a> Do no or only minor modifications at once to the
    examples included in [Build Examples](README.md#build-examples).
    If it doesn't work, fall back to documented examples _as is_.
9.  <a name="trbl-9"></a> If everything fails and you are to report a build
    problem to Harbour developers, make sure to include your OS
    version/language/CPU architecture, Harbour revision, C compiler
    name/release and version, environment variables and verbose log output
    containing **both stderr and stdout in one combined stream**
    (use `make > log.txt 2>&1`). Enable verbose mode using
    `HB_BUILD_VERBOSE=yes`. Preferably, configure your tools to output
    English language messages.
    Complete log output is rarely necessary, but make sure to include
    the top of the output (lines starting with `!`) and the area where
    problematic behavior occurred _first_. Make sure to not only include
    a link failure or a make tool failure, as it's most of the time not
    enough information. Compress your log using zip if it is larger
    than 25kB (use the extension `.zip`).
    With these, you have much better chance to get useful or any response.
10. <a name="trbl-10"></a> Do not alter the directory layout and files in
    Harbour and 3rd party packages and tools (including C compilers).
11. <a name="trbl-11"></a> If you are to report a build problem with
    a Harbour application, all the above points apply, plus make sure
    to use `hbmk2` with the `-trace` command-line option and redirect its
    output to a file (see above how). Also include your full command-line
    and any referenced build script in your report.
    It is good idea to first remove all manual references to Harbour
    core components from makefiles and custom environment. F.e. it's
    commom mistake to add C compiler header and/or lib dirs, Harbour core
    header and/or lib dirs, built-in constants to makefiles or environment.
    No such thing is necessary as all of these are automatically handled
    by `hbmk2`. IOW start simple and don't be overbusy with *fine-tuning*
    your configuration. If you need to, the problem is most probably
    elsewhere. It's also good idea to try with the latest Harbour revision
    or Harbour's mainline branch first.
12. <a name="trbl-12"></a> If you are to report a problem with Harbour
    itself, provide self-contained, minimal source code example. Do not use
    `xhb` contrib library (including `hbcompat.ch`), nor any 3rd party Harbour
    libraries.
    The example shall reproduce the problem using the latest Harbour revision
    (with _no_ local commits or pending local modifications)
    at the time of the report. Do not post links to executables and other
    binary files. If your source contains non-ASCII and non-UTF-8 national,
    accented, special chars, make sure to mark the codepage/encoding used
    and use `Chr()`/`hb_BCode()` calls to form the strings. Use UTF-8 if
    possible. Notice that code examples are likely to be executed as
    `hbrun` scripts for testing, so it's a good idea to make them work this
    way.<br />
    Also make sure not to report multiple issues under a single GitHub Issue.<br />
    * See more on self-contained examples:
      * <http://sscce.org/>
      * <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve>
    * See more on how to report issues in an effective and useful way:
      <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>
13. <a name="trbl-13"></a> Please do not report warnings or bugs &ndash;
    except of _build errors_ &ndash; in 3rd party component hosted inside
    the Harbour source tree. You can recognize these by their source path,
    which always contains a subdirectory named `/3rd/`. Report
    these to the maintainer(s) of the respective component instead.
14. <a name="trbl-14"></a> If your example or report contains human readable
    text, use English only.
15. <a name="trbl-15"></a> If your example involves compatibility components,
    make sure to test it against original implementation (for example, test
    legacy Cl\*pper core language elements against real CA-Cl\*pper 5.2e or
    5.3b, or `hbct` functions against CT3 library, etc)
    Notice that Harbour is Cl\*pper Summer '87 compatible exactly as
    much as Cl\*pper 5.2e/5.3b is, meaning: almost, but not completely.
    For Cl\*pper testing,
    use this nice and free [MS-DOS emulator](https://www.vdos.info/) (for Windows).
