NSX description:
1. Keys are stored in interior (branch) and exterior (leaf) nodes
   like in NTX not a CDX where all keys are in leaf nodes and keys
   in interior nodes are duplicated higher key value in subnodes.
2. The hidden part of index key is record number what causes that
   keys are always unique (like in CDX not in NTX)
3. Because the leaf and branch nodes have different internal structure
   it's necessary to keep the index tree well balanced (all leaf
   nodes have to be located at the same level). The number of keys
   in leaf pages is variable and the keys in interior node records
   are not duplicated in leafs so when index is created it's impossible
   to calculate the optimal tree in one pass. To resolve this problem
   at the end empty pages (without keys) must be added to the tree.
   Then the keys in the two last pages at each level can be balanced
   if we want to keep strict minimum keys in page factor or want to
   eliminate empty pages though it's not necessary in interior nodes.
   Only last leaf page cannot be empty because it breaks classic index
   navigation code. To resolve this problem SIX3 NSX RDD moves the
   last key added to index from branch node to the last empty leaf
   node and then moves the last key from the leaf node before last
   to the branch page from which the last index key was taken. It
   does not balance the right most pages. This may not work correctly
   for unique indexes if the last key is not added to the index because
   it's replicated. In such case SIX3 creates buggy indexes - Harbour
   will report them as corrupted after dbGoBottom(). Harbour creates
   correct indexes.
4. All numbers are in little endian byte order
5. The numeric and date key values are modified IEEE754 double value
   8 bytes length (the same format as in CDX), the logical values are
   1-byte length "T" or "F"
6. Minimum RecNoLen used by SIX3 driver seems to be 2 and maximum 3!!!
   It means that tables with more then 167772165 are not supported.
   SIX3 RDD creates indexes for them but they are buggy and the most
   important byte in record number is lost. It cannot be easy detected
   in normal navigation so Harbour will report corruption error only
   during update operation if previous key value with valid record
   number cannot be located. Harbour RDD does not have such limit
   and can support 2^32-2 records = 4294967294.
7. Branch nodes have also field to mark record len (RecNoLen) but
   it seems to be unused (filled with 0 or 4) and record number is
   always stored in 4 bytes.
8. Maximum key len is set to 250 but in fact with 4 bytes record len
   such keys cannot be supported without adding some hack because
   RecNoLen[4] + Size[1] + DupCount[1] + 250 gives 256 and it cannot
   be stored in 1 byte (Size). We can add support for such long
   indexes but we have to define that Size=0 means Size=256. It can
   be done because Size=0 cannot appear in other way. I implemented
   it and Harbour works well with such indexes.
9. In root header is address of 1-st available free page in index file,
   addresses of next pages are stored in the free pages at the same
   position as in root header (offset = 6)
10.Leaf nodes use for duplicate compression keys' values from upper
   interior nodes so it's necessary to keep them on the index tree
   stack. The first key in index is not compressed at all.
11.Non duplicated part of key in leaf page is compressed by RLE
   algorithm and special RLE char is 0xFF.
12.During indexing SIX3 NSX RDD adds key to leaf node only if it can be
   added in raw form without any compression. It checks if free space
   in leaf node is at least KEY_LEN + RECNO_LEN + 2 and if it is
   then it always adds key. It should be safe but seems that it uses
   hard coded RECNO_LEN=2 value so when RECNO_LEN is 3 (DBF has more
   then 64645 records) the last byte from key can be lost!!! and corrupted
   index is created. Harbour NSX RDD checks if there is enough space for
   fully compressed key. It also means that it can hold more records in
   leaf nodes and total index size is usually smaller then in SIX3.
   SIX3 can use Harbour indexes though I cannot be sure if they will not
   cause some other memory buffer overflows like the one described above
   in SIX3 code. I only hope that not or at least they will not be critical.
13.During index update SIX3 NSX do not execute any code to balance key in
   index nodes to keep some minimum number of keys in page. It may cause
   that in systems with a lot of updates indexes will be much bigger then
   they should. It means that it's good to make some temporary reindexing.
   The base Harbour implementation replicate this behavior but it may
   change in the future and I'll add some code to keep keys in index
   pages well balanced. In well balanced indexes exist some conditions
   which can make whole code much simpler but unfortunately if we want
   to be SIX3 compatible we cannot use them because after updating index
   by SIX3 we will lost them.
14.Harbour do not use any tricks with byte oriented sorting and pass
   whole index keys for comparison to CP compare function which respects
   all national settings. Such tricks may speed up some operations but
   they break sorting in languages which uses multibyte characters or
   accented characters with the same weight as normal ones.
15.The default memo type in DBFNSX is set to SMT. It will affect only
   newly created files (dbCreate()). When DBF table is open memo type
   is detected automatically in all DBF* Harbour's RDDs. If you want
   to change default memo type for new DBF files then use:
      rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOTYPE, DB_MEMO_FPT, "DBFNSX" )
   or:
      rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOTYPE, DB_MEMO_DBT, "DBFNSX" )
16.Harbour NSX implementation in default format supports NSX files
   upto 4GB. This is maximum keeping binary compatibility with SIX3
   NSX RDD. But Harbour can support files up to 4TB - it's a little
   bit modified format with 'I' instead of 'i' in index header signature.
   Such indexes are created when locking mode is set to 64bit. On open
   Harbour RDDs automatically recognize type of index files so it
   can use new format also with different locking schemes. SIX3 NSX
   cannot use new index.
17.This version do not have yet any speed optimization in navigation
   and index update code for easier detecting any problems with SIX3
   compatibility. I'll add it later.

LEAF KEY COMPRESSION:
   a. store record number (RecNo)
   b. count duplicated characters
   c. if full key is duplicated then key size = n + 1 and goto @g
   d. count trailng characters to the duplicate limit
   e. if rest of key value (without dup and trail chars) is not empty
      then store it using RLE compression:
      - replace each repeated 3 or more characters with with FF xx yy
      - replace each FF character with FF 01
      - if compressed key size is greater or equal then KEY_SIZE - DupCount
        break compression and store the key as raw data coping source,
        key size = KEY_SIZE - DupCount + n + 2
   f. store number of duplicated characters (DupCount)
   g. store key size (Size)
   Harbour NSX RDD has small extension here and also compressed two
   repeated 0xFF character so instead of FF 01 FF 01 it stores FF 02 FF
   It saves one byte and can be still decoded by SIX3 NSX RDD
