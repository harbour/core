The Harbour virtual machine (VM)

Question :

  If a VM description is desirable, how should it be structured? (I
propose plain text, with two main sections: VM description, Opcodes. The
"Opcodes" section would describe every opcode: mnemonic, code, operands,
description. I think I can maintain this section.)

Answer :

The VM is formed by the main execution loop and several subsystems, each of
which could be theoretically replaced, supposing that you respect the
interface of each subsystem.

The main execution loop is defined in the C function named VirtualMachine(),
which receives two parameters: the pcode instructions to execute and the
local symbol table (a portion of the OBJs (static) symbol table) used by
that pcode: (please review hbpcode.h for the currently implemented pcode
opcodes)

VM( pcode, local symbols )

The VM may invoke the VM (itself) again. This lets the Clipper language
access Clipper functions and methods and external C language functions again
and again. The VM organizes these multiple accesses in an ordered and
fully controlled way, and implements services to access these multiple
execution levels (ProcName(), ProcLine(), debugging, and stack variables
access).

The VM subsystems are continuously used by the main execution loop. Let's
review these VM subsystems:

The startup: Controls the initialization of the different VM subsystems.
It is invoked at the beginning of the application. It also controls the
exiting of the application.

The stack: The VM does not use the stack of the computer directly, it uses
instead its own stack for manipulating values (parameters, returned values,
and symbols) as a hardware stack does.

The static symbol table: Created by the compiler at compile time (and
grouped by the linker on OBJs), this subsystem is responsible for an
immediate access to functions location and it is highly related to the
dynamic symbol table at runtime. It contains many duplicated symbols that
will be optimized by the dynamic symbol table.

The dynamic symbol table: Dynamically generated from the startup subsystem
at the beginning of the application. It organizes in an efficient way the
static symbol table creating an alphabetical index that allows a dicotomic
search of symbols. This subsystem is responsible for quick access to symbols
(functions, variables, fields and workareas aliases).

The static and public variables: Responsible for storing public and static
variables.

The memory: Responsible for allocating, reallocating, locking, unlocking and
freeing memory.

The extend system: Defines the interface (_parc(), ..., _retc() ) from low
level (C language) to high level (Clipper language). This subsystem is
responsible for connecting in a proper way C language functions to the
entire application.

Multidimensional arrays: This subsystem allows the creation of arrays, and
the services to manipulate these arrays in all ways. The arrays are
extensively used by the Clipper language and also they are the foundation of
the Objects (Objects are just arrays related to a specific Class).

The Objects engine: Responsible for the creation of Classes and Objects. It
also defines the way to access a specific Class method to be invoked by the
VM and provides all kind of Classes information that may be requested at
runtime.

The macro subsystem: it implements a reduced compiler that may be used at
runtime to generate pcode to be used by the application. In fact it is a
portion of the harbour yacc specifications.

The workareas subsystem: Responsible for databases management. It defines
the locations where the used workareas will be stored and provides all the
functions to access those workareas. It also implements the interface to the
replaceable database drivers.

Question :

  Will Harbour opcodes mimic the Clipper ones? (will there be a 1:1
relation between them?) If so, are Clipper opcodes described somewhere?

Harbour will not implement all of them as we want to provide the highest
freedom to programers to extend and modify Harbour as needed. In example:
Clipper language uses opcodes for: Row(), Col(), Upper(), Space(),
Replicate(), Inkey(), Year(), Month(), etc... where we may just call a
standard C function, that uses the standard extend system and that may be
easily modified. So Harbour will use much less opcodes than the Clipper
language. This will also help to have a simpler and easier to maintain
compiler and VM.

Question :

  I see that, for example, Harbour has an opcode named "PUSHWORD"(06),
while Valkyre calls it "PUSHW"(3B): Different names, different codes.
Isn't it desirable that Harbour pCode be binary-compatible with Clipper? I
mean, by doing so, Harbour VM could interpret Clipper pCode and
vice-versa.

Answer :

Harbour opcodes are defined in hbpcode.h. We are trying to use very easy to
remember mnemonics, so PUSHWORD seems easier than PUSHW. The opcodes values
are meaningless as they are just used by a C language switch sentence (in
fact there is a powerful optimization which is to use the pcode opcodes
themselves as an index to a VM functions pointers array, so VM execution
speed may increase. Clipper uses it).

We are not fully implementing the Clipper language OBJs model (i.e. to
provide identifiers names length higher than 10 chars) so Harbour OBJs will
not be supported by Clipper and viceversa.

sorry for such a long message :-)
