                  Harbour TODO list

=======================================================================
Tasks for after v1.0 release:
-----------------------------

Assign to: Ryszard
Detail...: SQLRDD.
Status...: Working on it.

***

Assign to: Przemek
Detail...: Define multi platform platform API for GTs which can mix
           graphics objects with standard text output. Now it's
           possible in GTXWC, GTWVT and GTALLEG. This I will discuss
           yet also with Harbour developers.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add support for remotely controlled GUI objects so we will
           be able to create GUI programs with GTNET.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add NETRDD - meta RDD which will allow transport layer
           between client application and server application with any
           other chosen RDD driver. Idea similar to GTNET but for RDD
           drivers - it's sth like ADS does.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Przemek
Detail...: Extended HB_IT_POINTER. In practice we can give them the
           same functionality as for objects and use them for fast
           creation objects at C level. We can also add HB_VALTYPE()
           function which will return the extended type name, f.e.
           "WINDOW", "FONT", "SOCKET" or anything what 3-rd party
           programmers may want to use. It will greatly simplify
           writing some libraries.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Jean-Francois Lefebvre (JFL)
Detail...: The following need to be added to the OO system:
           Class Method, Multiple Constructor, Class init Support.
Status...: Open.
