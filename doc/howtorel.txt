How to create and tag a new release
===================================
By Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)


1. Make full update of your local CVS copy with:
    cvs -z3 update -A -P -d -R harbour
   with the above unused empty directories will be removed
   from your repository copy.
   Please check if all your files are unmodified. You can redirect
   stdout output from cvs command to a file to see if all files are
   exactly the same.
2. Update files which contain Harbour release number. Now these are:
    harbour.spec
    include/hbver.h
3. Set proper release date in NEWS (found as doc/oldnews.txt) and
   if necessary update release informations. Also add the exact
   tag name to this file, for example "tag: build46".
4. Update ChangeLog.txt and commit your modifications.
5. Update hbver.h with ChangeLog.txt file ID and your last entry ID.
6. Tag the CVS tree with the new release tag:
    cvs tag -t -F -D <local_daytime_or_other_with_TZ_info> <newtag>
   for example:
    cvs tag -t -F -D "2006-05-29 16:00" build46
   With the above you can also "re-tag" already set tag so be careful
   and use re-tag repository _only_ if it's really necessary.


With properly tagged CVS any one who wants to create Harbour release
binaries should make:
    cvs -z3 co -r <reltag> harbour
for example:
    cvs -z3 co -r "build46" harbour
to be sure that local repository copy is exactly the same as the one
tagged as new release. The first commit after cvs tagging should also
change the version number and ChangeLog IDs in harbour.spec and
include/hbver.h for easier locating possible mistakes when release
binaries are created.
