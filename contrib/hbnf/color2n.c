/* This is an original work by David Richardson and is placed in the

      Rev 1.1   22 Apr 2004 15:44:00   DGH
   Fixed compiler warnings about pointer vs. integer by changing NULL to 0.
   Commented out #ifdef and #endif lines, because there is nothing that is
   even remotely platform-specific in the code.

      Rev 1.0   01 Jan 1995 03:01:00   TED
