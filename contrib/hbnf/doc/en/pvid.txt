   $CATEGORY$
      Video
   $ONELINER$
      Save current video states on internal stack.
   $SYNTAX$
      ft_PushVid() -> <nStackSize>
   $ARGUMENTS$
      None
   $RETURNS$
      The current size of the internal stack (i.e. the number of times
      ft_PushVid() has been called).
   $DESCRIPTION$
      Menus, picklists, browses, and other video-intensive items often
      require you to save certain video states -- screen image, cursor
      position, and so forth.  Constantly saving and restoring these items
      can get very tedious.  This function attempts to alleviate this
      problem.  When called, it saves the cursor position, color setting,
      screen image, cursor style, blink setting, scoreboard setting, snow
      setting, and maximum row and column to a series of static arrays.  All
      that is needed to restore the saved settings is a call to ft_PopVid().
   $EXAMPLES$
      ft_PushVid()          // Save the current video states

      ft_PopVid()
   $CATEGORY$
      Video
   $ONELINER$
      Restore previously saved video states.
   $SYNTAX$
      ft_PopVid() -> <nStackSize>
   $ARGUMENTS$
      None
   $RETURNS$
      The number of items remaining in the internal stack.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This is the complementary function to ft_PushVid().  At some time
      after saving the video states it will probably be necessary to restore
      them.  This is done by restoring the settings from the last call to
      ft_PushVid().  The number of items on the internal stack is then
      reduced by one.  Note that the use of stack logic means that items on
      the stack are retrieved in Last In First Out order.
   $EXAMPLES$
      ft_PopVid()          // Restore video states
