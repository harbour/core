   $NAME$
      ft_IsBitOn()
   $CATEGORY$
      String
   $ONELINER$
      Determine the state of individual bits in a number
   $SYNTAX$
      ft_IsBitOn( <nNumber>, <nBit> ) -> lResult
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nNumber> is an integer for which a bit state needs to be checked.

      <nBit> is a number from 0 to 15 that indicates which bit to test.
   $RETURNS$
      .T. if the specified bit was on., .F. if off.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function is useful when dealing with binary integers.  It will
      come in very handy if you use the ft_int86() function, because the
      CPU flags are returned as a series of bits.  Using this function, you
      can determine the state of each CPU flag.
   $EXAMPLES$
      IF ft_IsBitOn( nCPUFlags, 0 )
         ? "The carry flag was set."
      ENDIF

      IF ft_IsBitOn( nCPUFlags, 7 )
         ? "The sign flag was set."
      ENDIF
   $END$
