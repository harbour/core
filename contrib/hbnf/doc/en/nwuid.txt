      ft_NWUID()
   $CATEGORY$
      NetWare
   $ONELINER$
      Return the current Novell NetWare User ID
   $SYNTAX$
      ft_NWUID( [ <nConnection> ] ) -> cUid
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nConnection> is a connection number, or logical station number,
      to find a userid for.  Under NetWare 286, this number can be from
      1 to 100.  Under NetWare 386, 1-250.  If not supplied, ft_NWUID()
      defaults to the current connection (i.e., the connection running
      the application).
   $RETURNS$
      A string containing the userid, or "login name."
      The maximum length of this string, as defined by current
      versions of Novell NetWare, is 48 characters.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      ft_NWUID() returns the current NetWare userid, or "login
      name."  This is useful for implementing security or audit
      trail procedures within your programs.

      There is no simple way a user can "fool" this function into
      retrieving an incorrect value, provided a NetWare shell is loaded.

      This function requires ft_int86() and ft_NWLStat()

      This function does NOT test for the existence of the NetWare shell.
      The behavior is undefined if no shell is loaded. You'll usually get
      garbage.  This function has not been tested on NetWare 386.
   $EXAMPLES$
      ? "I am: " + ft_NWUID()

      FOR x := 1 TO 100
         cUid := ft_NWUID( x )
         IF ! Empty( cUid )
            ? Str( x, 3 ) + Space( 3 ) + cUid
         ENDIF
      NEXT
   $END$
