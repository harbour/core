   $NAME$
      ft_NWLStat()
   $CATEGORY$
      NetWare
   $ONELINER$
      Return the current Novell NetWare logical station number
   $SYNTAX$
      ft_NWLStat() -> nStatNum
   $ARGUMENTS$
      None
   $RETURNS$
      A numeric corresponding to the current logical station number
      assigned by NetWare.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      In order to find out information about a particular node logged
      in to a NetWare server, you will need the logical
      station number, also known as a "connection number."  This
      function will return that number.  This will be a number from 1 to 100
      under NetWare 286, or from 1 to 250 under NetWare 386.  This is *not*
      the same as a physical station number.

      This function requires ft_int86().

      This function does NOT test for the existence of the NetWare shell.
      The behavior is undefined if no shell is loaded.
   $EXAMPLES$
      ? "Logical station: " + Str( ft_NWLStat() )
