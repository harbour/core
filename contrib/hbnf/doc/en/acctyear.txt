   $SYNTAX$
      ft_AcctYear( [ <dGivenDate> ] ) -> aDateInfo
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <dGivenDate> is any valid date in any date format.  Defaults
      to current system date if not supplied.
   $RETURNS$
      A three element array containing the following data:

         aDateInfo[ 1 ] - The year as a character string "YYYY"
         aDateInfo[ 2 ] - The beginning date of the accounting year
         aDateInfo[ 3 ] - The ending date of the accounting year
   $DESCRIPTION$
      ft_AcctYear() creates an array containing data about the
      accounting year containing the given date.

      An accounting period has the following characteristics:

      If the first week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
      days, it is included in the period; otherwise, the first
      week was included in the prior period.

      If the last week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
      days it is included in the period; otherwise, the last week
      is included in the next period.  This results in 13 week
      'quarters' and 4 or 5 week 'months'.  Every 5 or 6 years, a
      'quarter' will contain 14 weeks and the year will contain 53
      weeks.

      // get info about accounting year containing 1990-09-15

      ? aDateInfo[ 1 ]   //  1990
      ? aDateInfo[ 2 ]   //  1989-12-31    beginning of year
      ? aDateInfo[ 3 ]   //  1990-12-29    end of year
