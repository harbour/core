      ft_PutKey()
   $CATEGORY$
      Keyboard/Mouse
   $ONELINER$
      Stuff a keystroke into the keyboard buffer
   $SYNTAX$
      ft_PutKey( <nKeyValue> ) -> lResult
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nKeyValue> is the Inkey() value of the keystroke to be stuffed.
   $RETURNS$
      .T. if the keystroke was put into the keyboard buffer.
      .F. if nKeyValue was invalid or the buffer was full.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function is similar to the KEYBOARD command, with a few
      exceptions. First, this function does not clear the keyboard buffer
      before inserting the keystroke.  In addition, since it uses the
      Inkey() value, you can stuff any key, including function keys, into
      the keyboard buffer. However, this also means that unlike the KEYBOARD
      command, you can only stuff one keystroke at a time.

      You can easily create a User-Defined Command that makes this function
      even more like the KEYBOARD command.  For example,

         #xcommand KEYSTROKE <key> => ft_PutKey( <key> )

      will create a command called KEYSTROKE that could be used as a
      companion command to KEYBOARD.  The only difference is that it would
      insert a single keystroke instead of a string.

      Be aware that this function makes use of Clipper's internal event
      handler.  If you don't like using internals, then don't use this
      function, you sniveling coward.

      This function is written to adhere to Turbo Assembler's IDEAL mode.
      To use another assembler, rearrange the SEGMENT and PROC directives
      and make any other necessary changes to the source code.
   $EXAMPLES$
      ft_PutKey( -9 )   //  Stuff the F10 key
      ft_PutKey( 276 )  //  Stuff the Alt+T key
      KEYBOARD 28       //  Stuff the F1 key using a User-Defined Command
