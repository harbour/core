   $SYNTAX$
      ft_XBox( [ <cJustType> ], [ <cRetWait> ], [ <cBorType> ],   ;
               [ <cBorColor> ], [ <cBoxColor> ], [ <nStartRow> ], ;
               [ <nStartCol> ], <cLine1>,  <cLine2>, <cLine3>,    ;
               <cLine4>, <cLine5>, <cLine6>, <cLine7>, <cLine8> ) -> NIL
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cJustType> is a character indicating the type of text justification.
      "L" or "l" will cause the text to be left-justified in the box.
      Centered text is the default.

      <cRetWait> is a character which determines if the function will wait
      for a keypress after displaying the box.  "W" or "w" will cause the
      function to wait for a keypress before returning control to the
      calling routine.  Not waiting is the default

      <cBorType> is a character which determines whether a single or double
      border will be displayed.  "D" or "d" will cause a double border to
      be displayed.  A single border is the default.

      <cBorColor> is a character string denoting the border color.  'N/W' is
      the default if this parameter is not a string.

      <cBoxColor> is a character string denoting the text color.  'W/N' is
      the default if this parameter is not a string.

      <nStartRow> is a number denoting the starting row.  If '99' is passed,
      the box is centered vertically.  If necessary, nStartRow is decreased
      so the entire box can be displayed.

      <nStartCol> is a number denoting the starting column.  If '99' is passed,
      the box is centered horizontally.  If necessary, nStartCol is decreased
      so the entire box can be displayed.

      <cLine1> thru <cLine8> are 1 to 8 character strings to be displayed.
      They are truncated to fit on the screen if necessary.
   $RETURNS$
      NIL
   $DESCRIPTION$
      ft_XBox() allows the programmer to display a message box on the screen
      without needing to calculate the dimensions of the box.  Only the upper
      left corner needs to be defined.  The function will calculate the lower
      right corner based on the number and length of strings passed.

      A maximum of eight strings can be displayed.  If a string is too long
      to fit on the screen it is truncated.

      The first seven parameters are optional.  The default settings are:
         Lines of text are centered.
         Control is returned to the calling routine immediately.
         A single line border is painted.
         The border is black on white.
         The text is white on black.
         The box is centered both vertically and horizontally.
   $EXAMPLES$
      // The following displays a two-line box with default settings:

      ft_XBox( ,,,,,,, "This is a test", "of the ft_XBox() function" )

      // The following uses all optional parameters and displays a three-line
      // box.  The box is left-justified with a double border.  It has a yellow
      // on red border and white on blue text.  The function will wait for a
      // keypress before returning control to the calling routine.

      ft_XBox( "L", "W", "D", "GR+/R", "W/B", 5, 10, ;
         "It is so nice", ;
         "to not have to do the messy chore", ;
         "of calculating the box size!" )
