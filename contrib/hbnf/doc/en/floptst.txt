   $CATEGORY$
      DOS/BIOS
   $ONELINER$
      Test diskette drive status
   $SYNTAX$
      ft_FlopTst( <cDirectory|nDrive> ) -> nStatus
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nDrive> is the diskette drive number, 0 = A:, 1 = B:
   $RETURNS$
      -1 - Wrong Parameters
       0 - Drive Loaded and ready to read or write
       1 - Drive Door Open or Diskette inserted upside down
       2 - Diskette is unformatted
       3 - Write protected
       4 - Undetermined
   $DESCRIPTION$
      ft_FlopTst() is designed as a full replacement for ISDRIVE().  Where
      ISDRIVE() returns just .T. or .F. depending if the diskette drive is
      ready or not, ft_FlopTst() returns a numeric code designating the
      diskette drive's status.

      ft_FlopTst() is particularly useful in backup and restore programs
      that need to test the floppy drive before writing/reading from a
      floppy disk.

      No testing has been performed on systems with more than 2 floppy
      drives.  If the third drive is "C" and the fourth "D" then there
      should be no problems.
   $EXAMPLES$
      iStatus := ft_FlopTst( "A:" )
      DO CASE
      CASE iStatus == 1
         ? "The door to drive A is open."
      CASE iStatus == 2
         ? "The diskette in drive A is not formatted."
      CASE iStatus == 3
         ? "The diskette in drive A is write-protected."
      CASE iStatus == 4
         ? "Something is wrong with drive A, but I don't know what."
      ENDCASE
   $END$
