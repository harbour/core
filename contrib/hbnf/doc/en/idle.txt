      Generate an idle event to allow incremental garbage collection.

      ft_Idle()
   $ARGUMENTS$
      None
   $RETURNS$
      NIL
   $DESCRIPTION$
      During memory-intensive operations that do not generate much in
      the way of idle states, the Clipper runtime may not get a chance to
      perform garbage collection of discarded memory.  This can eventually
      lead to any of a variety of memory-related internal errors.

      This function attempts to alleviate the problem by providing a
      mechanism by which an idle event can be artifically generated at
      will.  The idle event will cause the CA-Cl*pper runtime to perform
      an incremental memory scavenge.

      This function makes use of an undocumented interal routine.  If this
      this fact makes you uncomfortable then don't use this function, you
      miserable jello-spined lump of human debris.
   $EXAMPLES$
      DO WHILE Whatever       // Some batch process
         Something()          // Create 'n' discard a bunch of stuff
         ft_Idle()            // Take out the garbage
      ENDDO
