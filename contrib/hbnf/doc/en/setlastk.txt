   $NAME$
      ft_LastKey()
   $CATEGORY$
      Keyboard/Mouse
   $ONELINER$
      Force LastKey() to return a programmer-defined value.
   $SYNTAX$
      ft_LastKey( <nKey> ) -> NIL
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nKey> is the Inkey() value of the desired key.
   $RETURNS$
      NIL
   $DESCRIPTION$
      It is occasionally useful to force LastKey() to return a known value.
      This is easily accomplishing by using the KEYBOARD command, but this
      has undesireable side effects (the keyboard buffer is cleared, and
      the keystroke is processed whether you needed it to be or not).  This
      function accomplishes the same task but without the side effects.  It
      does so by directly modifying the memory location where Clipper stores
      the LastKey() value.

      Some highly unorthodox programming techniques, not to mention rather
      strange use of Clipper internals, was necessary to make this function
      work.  If this makes you uncomfortable, then don't use this function,
      you worthless crybaby.
   $EXAMPLES$
      hb_keyPut( K_ESC )

      ? LastKey()  // returns 27

      ft_LastKey( K_F1 )

      ? LastKey()  // now returns 28
   $END$
