   $ARGUMENTS$

      to current system date if not supplied.

      <nWeekNum> is a number from 1 to 52 signifying a week.

   $RETURNS$
      A three element array containing the following data:

         aDateInfo[ 1 ] - The year and week as a character string "YYYYWW"
         aDateInfo[ 2 ] - The beginning date of the accounting week
         aDateInfo[ 3 ] - The ending date of the accounting week
   $DESCRIPTION$
      ft_AcctWeek() returns an array containing data about the
      accounting week containing the given date.

      An accounting period has the following characteristics:

      If the first week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
      days, it is included in the period; otherwise, the first
      week was included in the prior period.

      If the last week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
      days it is included in the period; otherwise, the last week
      is included in the next period.  This results in 13 week
      'quarters' and 4 or 5 week 'months'.  Every 5 or 6 years, a
      'quarter' will contain 14 weeks and the year will contain 53
      weeks.
