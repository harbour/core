   NOTE: Above libraries are from Cache version 2007.1.0.369
         2007.1 is no longer a supported version so these 
         cannot be obtained from their trial or licensed packages. 
         That's why I have to include them in the repository.
         I could never get any higher version .dlls usable 
         with our CacheRDD, so we will stay with it. It is 
         good for all the versions of Ccahe from 2007 until now.
