/* This implementation uses different rules then xHarbour one.
 * It does not change current drive or current directory so
 * unlike the xHarbour version it's MT safe.
 * It also returns relative paths which are more similar to
 * Directory() function results so they can be easy used
 * directly in other code, f.e. to create archive without
 * absolute paths. Please note that user can easy convert
 * relative paths to absolte ones by simple adding CurDir()
 * and/or cPath parameter passed to DirectoryRecurse() but
 * reverted conversion may not be possible in some cases.
 * The 3-rd xHarbour parameter <lCaseMach> is ignored because
 * harbour uses platform native rules to check filename mask
 * respecting SET FILECASE and SET DIRCASE settings.
 * xHarbour does not add "D" to attribute list used for directory
 * tree scanning so user always have to add it manually and later
 * it ignores it so it's not possible to extract file list with
 * directories entries. In Harbour it's fixed.
