/*
 * Using sqlite3_backup_*()
 *
 * This API is used to overwrite the contents of one database with that
 * of another. It is useful either for creating backups of databases or
 * for copying in-memory databases to or from persistent files.
 *
 * sqlite3_backup_init() is called once to initialize the backup,
 * sqlite3_backup_step() is called one or more times to transfer the data
 *                       between the two databases, and finally
 * sqlite3_backup_finish() is called to release all resources associated
 *                       with the backup operation.
