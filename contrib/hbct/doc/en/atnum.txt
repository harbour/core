      [<nCounter>]        determines how many occurences are of

      <cRestString>       the portion of <cString> after the <nCounter>th

                          is returned.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function scans <cString> for <cStringToMatch>. After the
      <nCounter>th match (or the last one, depending on the value of
      <nCounter>) has been found, the portion of
      <cString> after that match will be returned. If there aren't enough
      matches or the last match is identical to the end of <cString>, an
      empty string will be returned.
      After a match has been found, the function continues to scan after
      that match if the CSetAtMupa() switch is turned off, with the
      second character of the matched substring otherwise.
      The function will also consider the settings of SetAtLike().
