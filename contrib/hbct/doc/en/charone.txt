      CharOne( [<cCharactersToReduce>,] <cString> ) -> cReducedString
   $ARGUMENTS$
      [<cCharactersToReduce>]    specifies the characters the multiple
                                 occurences of which should be reduced to one
                                 Default: All characters.
      <cString>                  specifies the processed string
   $RETURNS$
      <cReducedString>           the string with the reduced occurences
   $DESCRIPTION$
      The CharOne() function reduces multiple occurences of characters in
      <cString> to a single one. It is important to note that the multiple
      occurences must occur directly one behind the other. This behaviour is
      is in contrast to the CharList() function.
   $EXAMPLES$
      ? CharOne( "122333a123" )      // "123a123"
      ? CharOne( "A  B  CCCD" )      // "A B CD"
      ? CharOne( " ", "A  B  A  B" ) // "A B A B"
      ? CharOne( "o", "122oooB12o" ) // "122oB12o"
