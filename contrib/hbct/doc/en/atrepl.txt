      AtRepl()
   $CATEGORY$
      CT3 string functions
   $ONELINER$
      Search and replace sequences in a string
   $SYNTAX$
      AtRepl( <cStringToMatch>, <cString>, <cReplacement>, [<nCounter>],
              [<lMode>], [<nIgnore>] ) --> cString
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cStringToMatch>   is the substring searched for in <cString>
      <cString>          is the processed string
      <cReplacement>     is the replacement for sequences found
      [<nCounter>]       specifies the number of replacements
                         Default: last occurence
      [<lMode>]          if set to .T., only the <nCounter>th sequence
                         of <cStringToMatch> will be replaced, else
                         all sequences will be replaced.
                         Default: .F.
      [<nIgnore>])       specifies how many characters in <cString> from
                         the beginning should be ignored by the function
                         Default: 0
   $RETURNS$
      <cString>
   $DESCRIPTION$
      The AtRepl() function searches and replaces sequences in a string.
      First, the function ignores the first <nIgnore> characters of <cString>.
      Then, if <lMode> is set to .T., it searches for the <nCounter>th
      occurence of <cStringToMatch> in <cString>. If successful, the
      sequence will be replaced with <cReplacement>.
      If <lMode> is set to .F., the same search is performed, but EVERY
      occurence of <cStringToMatch> till the <nCounter>th (inclusive) will
      be replaced with <cReplacement>. Note that, in this case,
      the replacements are performed even if the <nCounter>th occurence
      does not exist.
      By using the CSetAtMupa() switch you can decide whether the
      function restarts searching after a found sequence of after
      the first character of that sequence.
      The function allows the use of wildcards in <cStringToMatch>
      and looks for the settings of SetAtLike().
   $EXAMPLES$
      ? AtRepl( "ABC", "ABCDABCDABC", "xx" )    // --> "xxDxxDxx"
      ? AtRepl( "ABC", "ABCDABC", "ZYXW" )      // --> "ZYXWDZYXW"
      ? AtRepl( "ABC", "ABCDABCDABC", "xx", 2 ) // --> "xxDxxDABC"
      ? AtRepl( "ABC", "ABCDABCDABC", "xx", 2, .T. )  // --> "ABCDxxDABC"
   $STATUS$
      Ready
   $COMPLIANCE$
      AtRepl() is compatible with CT3's AtRepl().
      Note the new, 6th parameter !
