There are many areas for improving HbSQLite; any of them are:

- Mimic the REPLACE command from Clipper
- A better dataset manipulation
- Made available other SQLite commands, etc.
- Changing to OOP, so the harbour code would be more compatible and easy 
  to use among different SQL databases.
- Enhance the sql query edit window (maybe with memoedit).
- Changing the DOS console user interface with a GUI look and feel.
- Remove or hidden public vars

put here what you want   :)
