                    The exception is that, if you link the Harbour libraries with other

                    Project under the name Harbour.  If you copy code from other
                    Harbour Project or Free Software Foundation releases into a copy of
                    Harbour, as the General Public License permits, the exception does
                    not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid isleading<br />
                    anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete
