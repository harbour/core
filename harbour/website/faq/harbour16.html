  <h2><a name="16"></a>2.10. Why was the GPL chosen as the licence for Harbour?<a name="WhyGPL"></a></h2>
<p>That's really a question best asked of each of the Harbour copyright

that reason more than any other, it appeared to give the maximum amount of
freedom and at the same time the correct degree of control over use and
distribution.</p>
