  <h2><a name="9"></a>2.3. Who is developing Harbour?<a name="WhoDevelopers"></a></h2>
<p>Many people. There are a small handful of people who could be called the
&quot;core development team&quot; but the actual set of people who are
contributing to the project is constantly in flux. Anyone can join the
&quot;development team&quot; and, if you've got something to offer the
project, you'll be more than welcome.</p>
<p>Anyone wondering who the core developers are should pop over to the <a href="/">Harbour project web site</a> and
look at the <a href="/crew.htm">crew list</a>.</p>
