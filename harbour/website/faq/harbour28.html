  <h2><a name="28"></a>3.8. Are there any development guidelines?</h2>
<p>Not as such no. That said, if you are going to cut some code for Harbour you
might want to consider the following random observations:
<ul>
<li>Harbour is written in both C and itself. As much as possible we stick
with ANSI C (any non ANSI code should be guarded with pre-processor
directives).</li>
<li>Too many comments are better than too few comments.</li>
<li>An ounce of testing can save a ton of debugging. Please ensure that,
when you change code, you attempt to compile and use Harbour before
submitting changes.</li>
<li>English is the nearest we've got to a common language. Where possible
please code in, comment in and document in English.</li>
<li>Please don't make use of code you don't have the right to use. For
example, don't go copying
<a href="harbour5.html#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a> header
files to make Harbour header files.</li>
<li>Have fun.</li>
</ul>
