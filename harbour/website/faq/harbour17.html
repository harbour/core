  <h2><a name="17"></a>2.11. What is the Harbour exception?<a name="HarbourException"></a></h2>
<p>There is one small wrinkle regarding the use of the GPL as the licence for
Harbour. Harbour comes in a number of parts, these can best be described as
the compiler (including pre-processor), the virtual machine and the run-time
library. The GPL dictates that anyone distributing binary versions of GPLd
code must make an offer of providing the source and that the code linked
against the GPLd code must also fall under the GPL. Failure to do so is a
breach of licence.</p>
<p>In Harbour terms this means different things depending on which portion of
Harbour you are considering. The compiler itself can live under the GPL, it
isn't part of the run-time and so poses no problem. This isn't true for the
<a href="http://harbour-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/harbour-project/trunk/harbour/src/vm/">HVM</a> and
<a href="http://harbour-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/harbour-project/trunk/harbour/src/rtl/">RTL</a> because they get linked into your application and so would
require that your code be distributed under a compatible licence. While the
Harbour developers would like to see you develop
<a href="harbour13.html#FreeSoftware">free software</a> they have decided to let you make this choice.</p>
<p>To solve this problem the developers have employed the &quot;Harbour
Exception&quot;. This idea comes from the GPL exception used by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">guile</a>. In effect,
the exception states that you must observe the GPL except when the code in
question is being used as the HVM and RTL of an application compiled with
Harbour.</p>
<p>The wording of the exception currently reads:
<blockquote>
The exception is that, if you link the Harbour libraries with other
files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of
linking the Harbour library code into it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This exception applies only to the code released by the Harbour
Project under the name Harbour.  If you copy code from other
Harbour Project or Free Software Foundation releases into a copy of
Harbour, as the General Public License permits, the exception does
not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid misleading
anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete
this exception notice from them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
If you write modifications of your own for Harbour, it is your choice
whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.
</blockquote>

Please note that the original wording of the exception was based on an
earlier version of the guile exception. That version of the exception was
less verbose and less clear. The wording of that version read:
<blockquote>
The exception is that if you link the Harbour Runtime Library (HRL) and/or
the Harbour Virtual Machine (HVM) with other files to produce an executable,
this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the
GNU General Public License. Your use of that executable is in no way
restricted on account of linking the RTL and/or HVM code into it.
</blockquote>

The Harbour sources are being converted over to the new exception as each
copyright holder makes the change. The intention is that every item of
source that uses the Harbour exception will clearly use the more verbose
version.</p>
