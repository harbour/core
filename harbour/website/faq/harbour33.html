  <h2><a name="33"></a>3.13. I can't submit Clipper code either, can I still help anyway?</h2>
<p>You could help out any number of ways. Documentation is one area where
volunteers are needed (it's a dirty job but someone has to do it). Perhaps
you could help maintain the
<a href="harbour27.html#WhatToDo">TODO list</a>?
How about creating and maintaining binary snapshots of each of the releases?</p>
<p>Simply put, if you really want to help Harbour development, you'll find a
way.</p>
