  <h2><a name="30"></a>3.10. So what's with all these language extensions then?</h2>
<p>Hey, come on, there aren't that many!</p>
<p>Seriously, ok, hands up, you've got us bang to rights. Harbour does include
some extensions to &quot;standard&quot; Clipper but you'll notice that
these extensions are, on the whole, either replacements for &quot;must
have&quot; 3rd party add-ons that people used with
<a href="harbour5.html#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a> or they are a feature that is native to
<a href="harbour56.html#ClipperCompilers">other Clipper compiler implementations</a>.</p>
