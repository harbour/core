  <H2><A NAME="29"></A>3.9. Is it ok to extend the language with some spiffy new feature?</H2>
<p>As a rule, no. As 
<A HREF="harbour7.html#WhatIsHarbour">stated earlier</A> Harbour is
designed, as much as possible, to be a 
<A HREF="harbour5.html#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</A> 5.2e compatible Clipper compiler (with some 5.3 bits
thrown in when it makes sense). As such, until such a time as we're all done
on the compatibility front, the 
<A HREF="harbour9.html#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</A> would prefer to keep the language as &quot;pure&quot; as
possible.</p>
<p>That said, if you've got an idea for something you think should be added to
the language please feel free to make your case on the 
<A HREF="harbour35.html#DevMailList">developer's mailing list</A>. Please note that emails along the lines of
&quot;I want feature <em>X</em> because I'd like to have it&quot; don't cut
much ice. Emails to that effect that actually offer a working patch might
cut a little ice. Preferably, you'll come to the list with a well thought
out and documented case for the addition of a new language extension and
you'll be willing to discuss the proposal.</p>
<p>Also, don't be upset if it is rejected, this is 
<A HREF="harbour13.html#FreeSoftware">free software</A> after all, if you really feel that the extension is
required you can maintain a patch in parallel or, if you really must (but
we'd prefer if you didn't), you could maintain a forked distribution of
Harbour.</p>
