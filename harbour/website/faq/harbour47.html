<p>The main advantage Harbour has over
<a href="harbour56.html#ClipperCompilers">other Clipper compilers</a> is that it is
<a href="harbour13.html#FreeSoftware">free software</a>. Harbour also attempts to remove some of the limits imposed by
the base implementation but the extent of this will depend on your chosen
platform.</p>
<p>The
<a href="harbour9.html#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a> make no claim that
Harbour is better or worse than
<a href="harbour56.html#ClipperCompilers">any other implementation of the language</a>, however, at the same time, each individual
developer can probably sing the praises regarding the area of Harbour they

advantages for <b>you</b>.</p>
