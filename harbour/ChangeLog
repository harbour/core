   - tests/strings3.prg
   * tests/Makefile
     - Removed strings3.prg

   * tests/rtl_test.prg
     + Added massive string comparison tests that used to be in strings3.prg.
       But don't feel sorry for me having to type all those lines in, because
       I didn't. Instead, I wrote a program based on strings3.prg that created
       each and every one of those TEST_LINE() lines in Comp_STRINGS() and in
       Exact_STRINGS(). The only problem is that Clipper can't compile the
       program anymore: RTL_TEST.PRG        Fatal C3023  Too many labels

19991118-12:50 GMT+1 Ryszard Glab <rglab@imid.med.pl>

    * source/vm/hvm.c
	* corrected code in hb_vmPopAlias() - the stack pointer was
	decreased before the call to hb_vmSelectWorkarea - later
	the error recovery code was overwriting the alias item which
	caused unreleased memory

19991118-06:05 EDT Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>

   * source/compiler/expropt.c
     ! Corrected the division optimization to return 0 for any attempt
       to divide by 0.
     ! Corrected the division optimization to only return a long when the
       result of dividing long values is a whole value instead of returning
       a long when the result is within the range of a long (the result of
       dividing a long by a long will always be within the range of a long).
     % Changed the double results to return 2 decimal places after division
       optimization, which still isn't correct (see the source code for
       TODO: NOTE 1), but is more accurate than returning 0 decimal places.

        for example:

        ? 2 + a:=5 -1

        This syntax is not allowed in Clipper and in new Harbour rules too

        It should be used:

        ? 2 + (a:=5) -1

19991116-15:05 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/memvars.c
    ! __MSAVE() Modified to save MEMVARs with names longer than 10 chars, the
      this way it's more Clipper compatible. But since only the first 10 chars
      of the name can be stored in the .MEM file, the complete name cannot
      be retrieved on RESTORE. One more issue: if you have multiple long name 
      which have the same first 10 chars, all these variables will be saved to 
      the .MEM file, with the same name.
      So to be 100% Clipper compatible you should compile Harbour with 
      -DHB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN=10. 
  * source/rtl/dates.c

   * source/rtl/classes.c

19991111-05:39 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/fm.c
    ! hb_xalloc() chaining bug fixed.
    ! hb_xrealloc() chaining bug fixed.
    - Removed the faulty handling of the hb_xrealloc() call with zero size,
      previously the memory block was considered freed but free() was never
      called. I think that until a free() call is not issued for an allocated
      block we should consider it allocated regardless of it's size. This way
      it's also faster and cleaner.
    % DeleteNode() moved to hb_xfree() since it's only used from one place now.
    % Casts removed from the non-FM_STATISTICS branches.

19991111-04:41 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/fm.c
    ! hb_xrealloc() several things fixed (access to the pointer after
      reallocating it, uneccessary structure initializations, access to NULL
      pointers of failed or zero size realloc), RTL_TEST GPF fixed.
    ! Simplified, optimized and fixed the dump part.
    + TODO added about inconsistent hb_xrealloc() behaviour.
    + Size is shown in the dump.
    % strcpy( p, "" ) calls optimized.

19991111-01:18 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/fm.c
    ! hb_xrealloc() check for a passed NULL pointer.
    ! hb_xrealloc() signature check moved before any MEMINFO usage.
    ! Explicit \n changed to hb_consoleGetNewLine() call.
    ! 256 buffer size for symbol names changed to HB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN constant.
    ! Now the hb_xrealloc() is returning a NULL pointer (instead of trash)
      when the passed length is zero, and it's also freeing the pointer with
      free().
    % hb_xrealloc() - pResult variable optimized out.
  * source/rtl/hbsetup.h
    + HB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN constant added to set the maximum handled symbol
      name length in Harbour (both compiler/runtime), this can be set to any
      value by specifying C_USR=-DHB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN=10 in the make process.
      TODO: Add support for the compiler to cut the symbols to this size on
            compile. This way the /10 switch may be replaced by this #define,
            since /10 works perfect when the RTL also "knows" about this limit,
            and is compiled using this limit.
  * include/hbtrace.h
    ! Every macro names prefixed with HB_
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    ! Explicit buffer sizes are now determined using the HB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN
      constant. They can't overrun anymore.
  * source/vm/dynsym.c
    % hb_dynsymGet(), hb_dynsymFindName() - Using local stack for temp symbol
      name buffer instead of hb_xgrab()/hb_xfree(). Some optimalizations.
      Now they will cut the symbol name to the HB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN size, so
      by setting this to 10, we're 100% Cl*pper compatible from this respect.
      These functions are now faster.

19991110-23:20 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * include/hbtrace.h
    % Excluded trace calls are converted to nohting instead of "do {} while 0"
      since the latter was generating jumps for MINGW32. This is now violating
      a -pedantic warning in GCC (duplicated ";"), so this may not be the
      perfect solution, but at least it doesn't generate any code.
  * source/rtl/fm.c
    ! Casts added.
    ! ulProcLine changed to USHORT.
    + Added signature support.
    + The whole mem tracing stuff can be excluded by a #define.
    + The memory trace info level is HB_TR_ERROR now, so that it gets logged
      by default.
  * tests/Makefile
    + fsplit.prg added.

   * source/rtl/filesys.c
     % Replaced several #if tests of three or more manifest constants with
       tests for new single manifest constants that are defined using just
       one instance of the multiple tests. The new manifest constants are:
       HB_FS_FILE_IO, HB_FS_SOPEN, and HB_FS_DRIVE_LETTER. This will lessen
       the chances of missing one instance when other compilers are added.
     % Replaced the use of PATH_MAX with _POSIX_PATH_MAX, which is always
       defined, even for non-Posix compliant compilers, and eliminated the
       PATH_MAX definition.

        * include/hbsetup.h:
        * source/rtl/gt/gtsln.c:
        * source/rtl/gtxxx.c:
        * source/rtl/mousexxx.c:
        Added an initial implementation of GT over S-lang.

        * source/rtl/inkey.c:
        Changed the order in which the #ifdef/#endif checks are done, to
        make sure the curses and S-lang implementations are picked up
        correctly.

        * config/linux/gcc.cf:
        * config/w32/gcc.cf:
        * config/w32/mingw32.cf:
        Added initial support for easily switching between curses and
        slang. This could be vastly improved.

        * tests/testbrw.prg:
        Added a piece of code bound to K_TAB, just for the fun of it...

19991109-01:58 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * samples/Makefile
    samples/cccppc/*.*
    + Fully CA-Clipper 5.x compatible PP written in Clipper added to the
      samples directory. It also has a special object system (SmallTalk like
      if I'm not mistaken), and it's a good test for the Harbour compiler.
      Note that Harbour can't yet compile it, due to hangs in several .PRG.
      (but it has an RMAKE makefile, so you can try it out)
      The .PPO files produced by this program are exactly the same as the
      ones produced by Clipper (with some really minor differences). Also note
      that this version may have some bugs, since the project was later
      rewritten and continued in C++, which is also Open Source, and you can
      find it at http://www.nexus.hu/cccpp/

      This great contribution was made by Levente Csisz r <lcsiszar@index.hu>

19991109-01:09 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/filesys.c

19991108-23:41 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/filesys.c
    % hb_fsWrite(), hb_fsReadLarge(), hb_fsWriteLarge() double var
      assigments optimized.
    * Some small cleanups.
  * tests/rtl_test.prg
    + Two new SOUNDEX() tests added.
    + FWRITE() tests for the truncate feature.
  * source/rtl/soundex.c
    ! SOUNDEX() - Fixed handling of accented/national characters.

19991108-09:25 GMT+1 Antonio Linares <alinares@fivetech.com>

19991108-07:38 GMT+1 Antonio Linares <alinares@fivetech.com>
   * source/rtl/classes.c
     * Arrays used for DATA ... INIT values, properly initalized.

   * config/os2/icc.cf
     % Now that source/vm/main.c includes either mainstd.c or
       mainwin.c, reference main.obj instead of main$(HB_MAIN).obj
       when HB_MAIN is defined.

   * include/filesys.h
     ! Only use hb_fsReadLarge() and hb_fsWriteLarge() if the size
       of a ULONG is different from the size of a UINT (was USHORT,
       which is always going to be smaller than a ULONG).

   * source/common/hbtrace.c
     ! The hb_trace module uses strcmp(), which means that it
       has to include <string.h> to keep C++ compilers happy.

   * source/rtl/filesys.c
     ! Only use hb_fsReadLarge() and hb_fsWriteLarge() if the size
       of a ULONG is different from the size of a UINT (was USHORT,
       which is always going to be smaller than a ULONG).

   * source/runner/stdalone/Makefile
     % IBM's Visual Age C++ compiler will not resolve main() from a
       library, so it is necessary to set HB_MAIN, if it isn't already
       set, so that icc.cf will know to include the main.obj module.

19991105-14:07 GMT+1 Ryszard Glab <rglab@imid.med.pl>

    *source/rtl/codebloc.prg

19991104-23:45 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/filesys.c
    ! hb_fsSeek() now returns 0 instead of -1 on error, just like Clipper.
    % hb_fsSeek() double assigments removed.
    ! hb_fsLock() last error code handling fixed for some platforms.
    % hb_fsCommit() small simplification, double assignment removed.

19991104-14:30 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>

   * source/pp/stdalone/hbpp.c
     ! Added third parameter (char *) to Hp_Parse() so that the
       Microsoft VC++ and IBM Visual Age C++ versions won't try
       to link in the hbppint module from the pp library.

   * source/rtl/mouse/mouseos2.c
     ! Changed the type of the static mouse handle variable from
       int to HMOU (for IBM Visual Age C++, but also works with GCC).

Thu Nov 04 14:32:06 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * source/common/hbtrace.c:
        * doc/tracing.txt:
        Added the possibility to direct tracing output to a file by
        specifying its name in the HB_TR_OUTPUT environment variable. The
        default is stderr.

        * include/hbtrace.h:
        * source/common/hbtrace.c:
        * doc/tracing.txt:
        Implemented a better way of tracing with support for several
        levels (ALWAYS, FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG), efficient
        compile-out of unwanted levels and level control using an
        environment variable at run-time. See doc/tracing.txt for detailed

Wed Nov 03 18:38:03 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * tests/testbrdb.prg:
        The test now restores the color setting and does a CLS before

        * tests/testbrw.prg:
        The test now remembers its device position, cursor setting and
        color and restores everything before exiting.

    % hb_strgreater() replaced with standard ANSI C function strcmp(), it's
      now a bit faster.
  * source/rtl/strings.c
    include/extend.h
    ! SUBSTR() bug fix in handling the error when the third parameter was not
      a string. (reported by Andi Jahja)
    - hb_strgreater() removed since it was same as strcmp()

19991028-22:30 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>

   * source/rtl/inkey.c
   * source/rtl/gt/gtdos.c
   * source/rtl/gt/gtwin.c
     + Added Ctrl+Break support for DJGPP.
     % Unified Ctrl+Break handling by modifying DOS (non-DJGPP) and
       Windows GT API Ctrl+Break handlers to set a global flag that
       hb_inkeyPoll() checks before checking for keyboard input.
       Otherwise, if the program is in a keyboard input loop, a second
       key may have to be pressed after the "Cancelled at:" message is
       displayed before the program will actually quit. NOTE: The DOS
       Ctrl+Break handling needs to be refined to handle Ctrl+Break and
       Ctrl+C separately and to pass the Ctrl+C keyboard code on to the
       Harbour application. This requires handling BIOS INT 1B for the
       Ctrl+Break key and requires a lower level DOS INT 23 handler for
       the Ctrl+C handling than is provided by the C setbrk() function.

   * source/rtl/isprint.c
     + Added support for Borland C REGS structure.

   * source/rtl/samples.c
     ! Changed 'if( ulLen >= 0)' to read 'if( ulLen >= 1)' so that the
       string conversion for the hours value will only be done when
       there is at least one character in the source string.

   * tests/inkeytst.prg
     + If the "skip" command line parameter is set to "BREAK", then
       SETCANCEL() will be enabled, otherwise it will be disabled.

19991028-14:12 GMT+1 Bruno Cantero <bruno@issnet.net>

  * source/rtl/strings.c
    source/rtl/descend.c
    include/extend.h
    % hb_strEmpty(), hb_str*cmp() a few optimalizations.
    + Using const keyword for hb_str*() function parameters.
    * Small formatting, some Hungarian notations adjusted.
    + CHR() STRICT mode replaced with a comment, that the buggy Clipper
      behaviour should (or should not) be implemented in the Harbour compiler
      optimizer.
  - tests/hardcr.prg
  - tests/mtran.prg
    tests/Makefile
    + These test files has been removed, since they were moved to RTL_TEST
  * tests/rtl_test.prg
    * Some CHR() tests simplified, one added to show the buggy Clipper
      behaviour.
    + HARDCR(), MEMOTRAN() tests added.

19991027-16:57 GMT+1 Antonio Linares
   * source/vm/mainwin.c

19991027-02:25 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/fm.c
    ! Fixed to display negative unreleased memory properly.
  * source/rtl/codebloc.c

19991026-19:55 EDT Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>
   * source/rtl/gt/gtwin.c
     * Added WINAPI to the handler func def.

Tue Oct 26 17:16:43 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * source/common/hbtrace.c:
        Now it is REALLY efficient; no copying, nothing.

        * source/rtl/set.c:
        * source/vm/hvm.c:
        Got rid of other ways of tracing. Hopefully now HB_TRACE() is the
        only, standard way used in Harbour.

        * source/runner/runlib.c:
        Added HB_TRACE() calls to the RUNNER library.

19991026-18:10 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/gt/gtwin.c
    + Ctrl+Break handler added for Win32 console mode, now Ctrl+Break will not
      break an application with SetCancel(.F.), and will terminate it with
      the proper message with SetCancel(.T.).
      INCOMPATIBILITY: With SetCancel(.F.) the inkey code 876 will be passed
      to Harbour which should be ignored and not returned by Inkey().
      David, could you check this ?
  * source/rtl/gt/gtdos.c
    + Ctrl+Break handler added for DOS character mode.
      Please test this, since I could only test if it compiles.
  * tests/tstalias.prg
    + New alias related tests added.

    ! ::ColorSpec now defaults to the proper color.
    + ColorDisp() inline method added.
    ! Display() changed back to hide cursor while displaying
    ! Display() fixed to use ::ColorSpec instead of SetColor()
    ! Display() is now selecting the proper colors from the ::ColorSpec
    ! Display() color now depends on ::HasFocus
    ! SetFocus(), KillFocus() fixed to call ::Display(), like in Clipper.
    + Dummy methods added for not yet implemented ones, TODOs added.
    - "Message" DATA removed
    + Exported/Private MESSAGEs grouped.

19991025-18:15 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>

   * include/hbwinapi.h

   * harbour/source/pp/hbpp.c
     % Changed "non directive" warning to level 3.

   * harbour/source/pp/hbppint.c
