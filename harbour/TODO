Tasks for after v.1 release:
----------------------------

Assign to: Ryszard
Detail...: SQLRDD.
Status...: Working on it.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add support for virtual file handles and registering some
           meta handles so it will be possible to make:
              h := fopen( "gzip:/tmp/myarchive.gz", FO_WRITE )
              fwrite( h, cData )
              fclose( h )
           or:
              h := fopen( "tcp:some.host:port", FO_WRITE )
              ...
           or:
              h := fopen( "|lpr -PLaserJet", FO_WRITE )
              ...
           or:
              h := fopen( "gunzip /tmp/myarchive.gz|", FO_READ )
              ...
           etc.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Przemek
Detail...: Define multi platform platform API for GTs which can mix
           graphics objects with standard text output. Now it's
           possible in GTXWC, GTWVG and GTALLEG. This I will discuss
           yet also with Harbour developers.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add support for remotely controlled GUI objects so we will
           be able to create GUI programs with GTNET.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add NETRDD - meta RDD which will allow transport layer
           between client application and server application with any
           other chosen RDD driver. Idea similar to GTNET but for RDD
           drivers - it's sth like ADS does.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Przemek
Detail...: Extended HB_IT_POINTER. In practice we can give them the
           same functionality as for objects and use them for fast
           creation objects at C level. We can also add HB_VALTYPE()
           function which will return the extended type name, f.e.
           "WINDOW", "FONT", "SOCKET" or anything what 3-rd party
           programmers may want to use. It will greatly simplify
           writing some libraries.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Jean-Francois Lefebvre (JFL)
Detail...: The following need to be added to the OO system:
           Class Method, Multiple Constructor, Class init Support.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Ryszard
Detail...: Real strong typing in the compiler.
Status...: Open.
