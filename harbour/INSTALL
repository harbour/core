   See this section: 'HOW TO PARTICIPATE'


1. HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR FROM SOURCE
===============================================

   ==========================================================================
   NOTE: Before reporting a problem to developers, make sure to read the
         'TROUBLESHOOTING' section in this document and try the suggestions
         you find there.
   ==========================================================================

   For all platforms you'll need:

   * Supported ANSI C compiler
   * GNU Make (3.81 recommended, minimum 3.79 required, see also platform details)
   * Harbour sources (2.0.0 or upper)

   on Windows hosts
   ----------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows CE, MS-DOS, OS/2, Linux)

      Platform specific prerequisites:

      1.) Windows XP or upper system is recommended to build Harbour.
      2.) Make sure to have your C compiler of choice properly installed
          in PATH. Refer to your C compiler installation and setup
          instructions for details. It's recommended to make sure no tools
          in your PATH belonging to other C compilers are interfering with
          your setup. It's also highly discouraged to keep multiple copies
          of the same compiler, or different versions of the same compiler
          in PATH at the same time. For the list of supported compilers,
          look up 'SUPPORTED PLATFORMS AND C COMPILERS' section.
      3.) GNU Make 3.81 or upper is required. A copy of this tool
          is included in all Harbour packages, so you don't have to do
          anything.
          If you want to get it separately, you can find it here:
             http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Extension/make/
          Unpack it to your PATH or Harbour source root directory,
          and run it as 'mingw32-make'.

      > win-make [install]

      To test it, type:
      > cd tests
      > ..\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on Windows hosts with POSIX shells (MSYS/Cygwin)
   ----------------------------------
      You can also use these shells to build Harbour on Windows.
      Generally it's recommended to use native shell though.

      > sh -c make [install]

      To test it, type:
      > cd tests
      > ..\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

      NOTE: When building for Borland C++ make sure that GNU Make
            is executed when typing 'make', Borland Make has the same name.

   on MS-DOS hosts
   ---------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows, OS/2, Linux)

      1.) Make sure to have your C compiler of choice properly installed
          (in PATH).
      2.) You need to get GNU Make. We recommend this link:
             ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/beta/v2gnu/mak381b.zip
          Unpack it to your PATH or Harbour source root directory.
          You can also use included copy named dos-make.exe instead.

      > make [install]

      To test it, type:
      > cd tests
      > ..\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on OS/2 hosts
   -------------
   (possible cross-build targets: MS-DOS, OS/2, Linux)

      1.) You need to get GNU Make. If you use OS/2 host, 3.81r3 or upper
          version is required. We recommend this link:
             ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/util/make-3.81-r3-bin-static.zip
          If you use other host, refer to other platform instructions in
          this section.
          You can also use included copy named os2-make.exe instead.

      > make [install]

      To test it, type:
      > cd tests
      > ..\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on Linux hosts
   --------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS, OS/2)

      $ make [install] [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

      To test it, type:
      $ cd tests
      $ hbmk2 hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on Darwin (OS X) hosts
   ----------------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS)

      Platform specific prerequisite:
         Xcode or Command Line Tools for Xcode installed

      $ make [install] [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

      To test it, type:
      $ cd tests
      $ hbmk2 hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

      NOTE: You can override default (host) architecture by adding
            values below to HB_USER_CFLAGS, HB_USER_LDFLAGS envvars,
            you can use multiple values:

            Intel 32-bit: "-arch i386"
            Intel 64-bit: "-arch x86_64"
            PPC 32-bit:   "-arch ppc"
            PPC 64-bit:   "-arch ppc64"

   on FreeBSD hosts
   ----------------
      Platform specific prerequisites:

      1.) You'll need to have the developer tools installed.
      2.) Then you'll need to install gmake and optionally bison.
          If you installed the ports collection, then all you need
          to do to install bison and gmake is to run the following
          commands, which may require that you run su root first to
          get the correct permissions:

          $ cd /usr/ports/devel/gmake
          $ make
          $ make install
          $ make clean
          $ cd /usr/ports/devel/bison
          $ make
          $ make install
          $ make clean

      $ gmake install

      To test it, type:
      $ cd tests
      $ hbmk2 hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on Minix hosts
   --------------

      Install GNU make and the GNU compiler/binutils toolchain from
      the Minix pkgsrc repository; for details see

      http://wiki.minix3.org/en/UsersGuide/InstallingBinaryPackages

   on BSD/HP-UX/Solaris/BeOS/Haiku/QNX/*nix hosts
   ----------------------------------------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS)

      $ gmake [install] [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]
      OR
      $ make [install] [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

      To test it, type:
      $ cd tests
      $ hbmk2 hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

      NOTE for sunpro on Solaris:
      ---------------------------
         If you have any GNU binutils stuff installed, do make sure
         /usr/ccs/bin (the location of the native Sun C compilation
         system tools) come *before* the GNU binutils components in
         your $PATH.


2. HOW TO DO A PARTIAL [RE]BUILD
================================

   If you want to [re]build only a specific part of Harbour, like
   one core library or all core libraries, or all contrib packages,
   you have to do everything the same way as for a full build, the
   only difference is that you first have to go into the specific
   source directory you want to [re]build. When starting GNU Make,
   all components under that dir will be [re]built:

      cd src/rtl
      <make> [clean] [install]

   If you want to rebuild one specific contrib package, use this:

      cd contrib/<name>
      ../../bin/<plat>/<comp>/hbmk2 ../make.hb [clean] [custom hbmk2 options]

      NOTE: 'install' doesn't work when doing a partial [re]build
            at this time. To work this around, simply avoid 'install'
            completely, do a complete rebuild or copy the created
            lib(s) manually.


3. HOW TO CREATE DISTRIBUTABLE PACKAGES
=======================================

   Source .tgz on *nixes
   ---------------------

      $ package/mpkg_src.sh

   Binary .tgz on *nixes
   ---------------------

      $ export HB_BUILD_PKG=yes
      $ make clean install

   Binary .deb on Linux
   --------------------

      $ fakeroot debian/rules binary

   Binary .rpm on Linux
   --------------------

      $ package/mpkg_rpm.sh

      You can fine-tune the build with these options:
         --with static      - link all binaries with static libs
         --with ads         - build components dependent on ads (rddads)
         --with allegro     - build components dependent on allegro (gtalleg)
         --with cups        - build components dependent on cups (hbcups)
         --with cairo       - build components dependent on cairo (hbcairo)
         --with curl        - build components dependent on libcurl (hbcurl)
         --with firebird    - build components dependent on firebird (hbfbird, sddfb)
         --with freeimage   - build components dependent on freeimage (hbfimage)
         --with gd          - build components dependent on gd (hbgd)
         --with mysql       - build components dependent on mysql (hbmysql, sddmy)
         --with odbc        - build components dependent on odbc (hbodbc, sddodbc)
         --with pgsql       - build components dependent on pgsql (hbpgsql, sddpg)
         --with localzlib   - build local copy of zlib library
         --with localpcre   - build local copy of pcre library
         --without x11      - do not build components dependent on x11 (gtxwc)
         --without curses   - do not build components dependent on curses (gtcrs)
         --without slang    - do not build components dependent on slang (gtsln)
         --without gpllib   - do not build components dependent on GPL 3rd party code
         --without gpm      - build components without gpm support (gttrm, gtsln, gtcrs)

   Binary .rpm on Linux (cross-builds)
   -----------------------------------

      for Windows:
         $ package/mpkg_rpm_win.sh
      for Windows CE:
         $ package/mpkg_rpm_wce.sh

   Binary .zip + .exe on Windows for all targets (except Linux)
   ------------------------------------------------------------

      > set HB_DIR_NSIS=%ProgramFiles%\NSIS\
      > set HB_DIR_ZIP=C:\info-zip\
      > set HB_BUILD_PKG=yes

      Then run build as usual with 'clean install' options.
      See: HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR FROM SOURCE

   Binary .zip on MS-DOS for all targets (except Linux)
   ----------------------------------------------------

      > set HB_DIR_ZIP=C:\info-zip\
      > set HB_BUILD_PKG=yes

      Then run build as usual with 'clean install' options.
      See: HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR FROM SOURCE

   Unified .7z + .exe installer for Windows
   ----------------------------------------

      > package\winuni\mpkg_win_uni.bat

      NOTE: Carefully read in-file instructions and do the necessary
            steps before calling the script.


4. HOW TO ENABLE OPTIONAL COMPONENTS BEFORE BUILD
=================================================

   Certain Harbour parts (typically contrib packages) depend on 3rd
   party components. To make these Harbour parts built, you need
   to tell Harbour where to find the headers for these 3rd party
   components.

   On *nix systems most of these 3rd party components will
   automatically be picked up if installed on well-known standard
   system locations.

   You only need to use manual setup if the dependency isn't available
   on your platform on a system location, or you wish to use
   a non-standard location. Typically you need to do this on non-*nix
   (Windows, MS-DOS, OS/2) systems for all packages and for a few packages
   on *nix which aren't available through official package managers
   (f.e. ADS Client).

   Note that Harbour is tuned to use 3rd party binary packages in their
   default, unmodified ("vanilla") install layout created by their
   official/mainstream install kits. If you manually move, rename,
   delete or add files under the 3rd party packages' root directory,
   the default Harbour build process (especially Windows implib
   generation) might not work as expected.

   You can set these environment variables before starting
   the build. Make sure to adjust them to your own directories:

   HB_WITH_ADS=C:\ads\acesdk
   HB_WITH_ALLEGRO=C:\allegro\include
   HB_WITH_BLAT=C:\blat\full\source
   HB_WITH_BZIP2=C:\bzip2 (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_CAIRO=C:\cairo\include\cairo
   HB_WITH_CUPS= (on *nix only)
   HB_WITH_CURL=C:\curl\include
   HB_WITH_CURSES= (on *nix systems and DJGPP, where it's autodetected)
   HB_WITH_EXPAT=C:\expat\lib (defaults to locally hosted version)
   HB_WITH_FIREBIRD=C:\Firebird\include
   HB_WITH_FREEIMAGE=C:\FreeImage\Dist
   HB_WITH_GD=C:\gd\include
   HB_WITH_GPM= (on Linux only)
   HB_WITH_GS=C:\ghostscript-9.01\psi
   HB_WITH_GS_BIN=C:\ghostscript-9.01\bin (on Windows)
   HB_WITH_JPEG=C:\jpeglib (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_LIBHARU=C:\libharu\include (defaults to locally hosted version)
   HB_WITH_LIBMAGIC= (currently on *nix systems)
   HB_WITH_LZF=C:\liblzf (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_MINILZO=C:\minilzo\ (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_MINIZIP=C:\zlib\contrib\minizip (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_MXML=C:\minixml (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_MYSQL=C:\mysql\include
   HB_WITH_OCILIB=C:\ocilib\include
   HB_WITH_ODBC= (may only be needed on non-Windows systems)
   HB_WITH_OPENSSL=C:\openssl\inc32 OR C:\openssl\include
   HB_WITH_PCRE=C:\pcre (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_PGSQL=C:\pgsql\include
   HB_WITH_PNG=C:\libpng (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_SLANG= (on *nix systems)
   HB_WITH_SQLITE3=C:\sqlite3 (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_TIFF=C:\libtiff (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_TINYMT=C:\tinymt\tinymt (defaults to locally hosted version)
   HB_WITH_WATT= (on MS-DOS systems)
   HB_WITH_X11= (on *nix systems)
   HB_WITH_XDIFF=C:\libxdiff-0.23\xdiff (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_ZLIB=C:\zlib (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)

   To explicitly disable any given components, use the value 'no' (without
   quotes). This may be useful to avoid autodetection of installed packages
   on *nix systems. You may also use the value 'local' to force using the
   locally hosted copy (inside Harbour SVN source tree) of these packages,
   where applicable. 'nolocal' will explicitly disable using locally hosted
   copy.

   Certain contribs can be instructed (when using .hbc files) to link
   against static build of their 3rd party lib dependencies (for
   advanced users only):
      HB_STATIC_ALLEGRO=yes
      HB_STATIC_CURL=yes
      HB_STATIC_OPENSSL=yes

   NOTES: - You need to use native path format to your shell/OS.
          - Spaces in directory names aren't currently supported.
            (You can use 8.3 name alias on Windows platform, though)
          - Don't put directory names inside double quotes.
          - Use absolute paths.

      NOTES: - You can use following commands on different distros to install packages:
                   openSUSE:       $ sudo zypper install <pkg>
                   Fedora, CentOS: $ sudo yum install <pkg>
                   Mandriva:       $ sudo urpmi <pkg>
               Check this link for more:
                   http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=package-management
             - On openSUSE, if you want to build 32-bit Harbour on a 64-bit host, install
               above packages with '-32bit' appended to their names, f.e. 'slang-devel-32bit'

   OpenSolaris
   -----------

      - $ pkg install SUNWsvn SUNWgcc SUNWgmake

   FreeBSD
   -------

      If you want to use the gtsln library instead of gtstd or gtcrs,
      then you also need to install libslang. If you installed the ports
      collection, then all you need to do to install libslang is to run
      the following commands, which may require that you run su first to
      get the correct permissions:

      $ cd /usr/ports/devel/libslang
      $ make
      $ make install
      $ make clean

6. OPTIONS AVAILABLE WHEN BUILDING HARBOUR
==========================================

   You can fine-tune Harbour builds with below listed
   environment variables. You can add most of these via the
   GNU Make command line also, using 'make VARNAME=value' syntax.
   All of these settings are optional and all settings are case
   sensitive.

   General
   -------
   - HB_INSTALL_PREFIX           Target root directory to install Harbour files.
                                 On *nix systems the default is set to /usr/local/
                                 or $(PREFIX) if specified, and
                                 /usr/local/harbour-<arch>-<comp> for cross-builds.
                                 It's always set to ./pkg/<arch>/<comp> when
                                 HB_BUILD_PKG is set to 'yes'. On non-*nix systems,
                                 you must set it to a valid directory when using
                                 'install'. Use absolute paths only. For a peace of
                                 mind, avoid using spaces and quotes in the name.
                                 You have to use path format native to your shell.
                                 F.e. to specify C:\dir on Windows, with Cygwin
                                 you should use /cygdrive/c/dir, with MSYS /c/dir.
                                 It's also possible to use following macros:
                                    {hb_plat} - Target platform
                                    {hb_comp} - Target compiler
                                    {hb_cpu}  - Target CPU

   - HB_USER_PRGFLAGS            User Harbour compiler options
   - HB_USER_CFLAGS              User C compiler options
   - HB_USER_RESFLAGS            User resource compiler options (on win, wce, os2)
   - HB_USER_LDFLAGS             User linker options for executables
   - HB_USER_AFLAGS              User linker options for libraries
   - HB_USER_DFLAGS              User linker options for dynamic libraries

   (* Only set these if autodetection doesn't suite your purpose:)
   - HB_PLATFORM                 Override platform autodetection
   - HB_COMPILER                 Override C compiler autodetection
                                 See this section for possible values:
                                 'SUPPORTED PLATFORMS AND C COMPILERS'
                                 See also: HB_CC* settings.

   Special
   -------
   - HB_BUILD_NAME=[<name>]      Create named build. This allows to keep
                                 multiple builds in parallel for any given
                                 platform/compiler. F.e. debug / release.
                                 NOTE: In current implementation it's
                                 appended to compiler directory name, so all
                                 filesystem/platform name rules and limits
                                 apply. (Back)slashes will be stripped from
                                 the name though.
   - HB_BUILD_PKG=yes            Create release package. Default: no
                                 Requires 'clean install' in root source dir.
   - HB_BUILD_DYN=no             Create Harbour dynamic libraries. Default: yes
   - HB_BUILD_CONTRIB_DYN=yes    Create contrib dynamic libraries. Default: no
   - HB_BUILD_SHARED=yes         Create Harbour executables in shared mode.
                                 Default: yes when HB_INSTALL_PREFIX points
                                 to a *nix system location, otherwise no.
   - HB_BUILD_DEBUG=yes          Create a debug build. Default: no
   - HB_BUILD_STRIP=
         [all|bin|lib|no]        Strip symbols and debug information from binaries.
                                 Default: no
   - HB_BUILD_OPTIM=no           Enable C compiler optimizations. Default: yes
   - HB_BUILD_MODE=[cpp|c]       Change default build mode to C++ or C.
                                 Default: c, except for msvc* compilers, where it's cpp.
   - HB_BUILD_PARTS=
         [all|compiler|lib]      Build only specific part of Harbour.
   - HB_BUILD_NOGPLLIB=yes       Disable components dependent on GPL 3rd party code,
                                 to allow Harbour for commercial (closed-source)
                                 projects. Default: no
   - HB_BUILD_3RDEXT=no          Enable autodetection of 3rd party components
                                 on default system locations. Default: yes
   - HB_BUILD_CONTRIBS=no [<l>]  Don't build any (or space separated <l> list of)
                                 contrib packages. Please note it won't prevent
                                 building packages which are dependencies of other
                                 (enabled) packages.
   - HB_BUILD_CONTRIBS=[<l>]     Build space separated <l> list of contrib
                                 libraries. Build all if left empty (default).
   - HB_BUILD_ADDONS=<l>         Build space separated <l> list of additional .hbp
                                 projects.
   - HB_COMPILER_VER=[<ver>]     Set C compiler version. This is used with win/msvc,
                                 win/mingw and cygwin/gcc targets currently.
                                 <ver> format:
                                     <15><0>[<0>] = <major><minor>[.<revision>]
                                 Default: filled by compiler autodetection or empty
   - HB_USER_LIBS=[<list>]       Add space separated <list> of libs to link process.
                                 Lib names should be without extension and path.
                                 You only need this in special cases, like CodeGuard
                                 build with bcc.
   - HB_INSTALL_IMPLIB=no        Copy import libraries created for external .dll
                                 dependencies to the library install directory in
                                 'install' build phase. Default: yes
                                 (for Windows/OS/2 targets only. Please note
                                 that this feature doesn't work with all possible
                                 binary distributions of 3rd party packages.
                                 We test only the official/mainstream ones. Also
                                 note that the generated implibs will require .dlls
                                 compatible with the ones used at build time.)
   - HB_SRC_ROOTPATH=<dir>       When using GNU Make older than 3.81, you shall set
                                 the root directory of Harbour source tree as an
                                 absolute path. If not set, some build functionality
                                 may fail, like detection of 3rd party packages with
                                 locally hosted sources.
                                 With newer make versions, this variable is ignored.
   - HB_REBUILD_EXTERN=yes       Rebuild extern headers. This is typically used by
                                 developers after code modifications or before
                                 release. Default: no
   - HB_REBUILD_PARSER=yes       Rebuild language parser sources. Typically
                                 you only need this if your are Harbour core
                                 developer modifying grammar rules (.y).
                                 Requires GNU Bison 1.28 or upper in PATH.
                                 Default: no
   - HB_CCPATH=[<dir>/]          Used with non-*nix gcc family compilers (and
                                 sunpro) to specify path to compiler/linker/archive
                                 tool to help them run from *nix hosts as cross-build
                                 tools. Ending slash must be added.
   - HB_CCPREFIX=[<prefix>]      Used with gcc compiler family to specify
                                 compiler/linker/archive tool name prefix.
   - HB_CCPOSTFIX=[<postfix>]    Used with gcc compiler family to specify
                                 compiler/linker tool name postfix
                                 (usually version number).

   Cross-building
   --------------

   You can build Harbour for target platforms different than host
   platform. F.e. you can create Windows build on *nix systems, Linux
   builds on Windows systems, etc. It's also possible to build targets
   for different than host CPU architectures. F.e. you can create
   Windows 64-bit build on 32-bit Windows platform, or Linux x86-64
   build on x86 hosts, or Linux MIPS build on x86 host, etc.

   Point this envvar to the directory where native Harbour executables
   for your host platform can be found:
      HB_HOST_BIN=<HARBOUR_NATIVE_BUILD_DIR>\bin

   If you leave this value empty, the make system will try to autodetect it,
   so in practice all you have to do is to create a native build first (no
   'install' required), then create the cross-build. If you set this value
   manually, it may be useful to know that harbour, hbpp and hbmk2
   executables are required for a cross-build process to succeed.


7. DEBUGGING OPTIONS
====================

   Tracing
   -------
      Build Harbour with:
         HB_BUILD_DEBUG=yes
      Run app with:
         HB_TR_LEVEL=debug
         HB_TR_OUTPUT=<filename> (to override default stderr output)
         HB_TR_SYSOUT=yes (to enable additional system specific logging output: OutputDebugString() on Windows, syslog() on *nix systems)

   Memory statistics/tracking
   --------------------------
      Build Harbour with:
         HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_FM_STATISTICS

   Valgrind (on linux and darwin targets)
   --------
      Build Harbour with:
         HB_BUILD_DEBUG=yes

      Build app with:
         $ hbmk2 myapp -debug

      Run app with:
         $ valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --num-callers=16 -v ./myapp 2> myapp.log

   CodeGuard (on win/bcc target only)
   ---------
      Build Harbour with:
         HB_USER_CFLAGS=-vG
         HB_USER_LIBS=cg32


8. EXAMPLES
===========

   for Windows (x86, 32-bit) hosts
   -------------------------------

      NOTES: - All code below should be copied to batch files or typed at command
               line.
             - Naturally, you'll need to adapt dirs to valid ones on your system.
               Don't use spaces in dirs.
             - You can use additional 'clean', 'install' or 'clean install'
               (without quotes) make parameters depending on what you want to do.
             - To redirect all output to a log file, append this after the make
               command: '> log.txt 2>&1' (without quotes)

      %ProgramFiles(x86)% for 32-bit and mixed tools, you can build for
      both x86 and x64 without building a native target first, and potential
      differences with some compilers in order to use native binaries if
      they are available.

10. TROUBLESHOOTING
===================

   Always evaluate these points before reporting an issue on the developers'
   mailing list.

   1.  Make sure to have carefully read this document.
   2.  Make sure to do a 'make clean' before doing a build after refreshing
       the sources.
   3.  If that still fails, make sure to install fresh source tree in a new
       local directory and start over. See 'HOW TO GET HARBOUR' section for
       instructions to get the source.
   4.  If you are doing a cross-build, make sure to have rebuilt the native
       Harbour executables for your host platform. See 'HB_HOST_BIN'
       build messages to find their location.
   5.  Keep your PATH clean from old, mixed compiler tools or other Harbour
       versions when building Harbour. The surest way to achieve this is to
       leave only C compiler directory in PATH:
          set PATH=C:\<compilerdir>
       If you use Harbour official binary distro on Windows, even above is
       unnecessary and not recommended.
   6.  Remove all old, unnecessary environment variables (for both Harbour
       and C compiler) from your environment. Also remove any custom settings
       for your C compiler.
       Use only those documented in this file.
       Follows some environment variable settings which are commonly believed
       by users to be useful, but which in reality are either not needed or
       not even used by Harbour build process and hbmk2.
       You can delete them:
          set HB_DIR=<Harbour root dir>
          set HB_PATH=<Harbour root dir>
          set HRB_DIR=<Some Harbour dir>
          set INCLUDE=<Harbour include dir>
          set LIB=<Harbour lib dir>
          set HB_GT_LIB=
          set HB_*_INSTALL=
          set HB_INSTALL_???=
          set HB_INC_*=
          set HB_DIR_*=
          set HB_LEX=
   7.  Remove any Harbour build settings documented in 'OPTIONS AVAILABLE WHEN
       BUILDING HARBOUR' section.
   8.  Try to do no or only small modifications at once to command examples
       included in 'EXAMPLES' section of this document. If it doesn't work,
       fall back to documented examples _as is_.
   9.  If everything fails and you are to report a problem to Harbour developers,
       make sure to include your OS version/language/CPU architecture,
       Harbour revision, C compiler name/release and version, environment
       variables and verbose log output containing _both stderr and stdout in
       one combined stream_ (use 'make > log.txt 2>&1'). Enable verbose
       mode using 'HB_BUILD_VERBOSE=yes'.
       Complete log output is rarely necessary, but always make sure to include
       the top of the output (lines starting with '!') and the area where
       problematic behavior occurred _first_. Make sure to not only include
       a link failure or a make tool failure, as it's most of the time not
       enough information. Compress your log using zip if it is larger
       than 25KB. (use the extension '.zip')
       With these, you have much better chance to get useful or any response.
   10. Do not alter the directory layout and files in Harbour and 3rd party
       packages.
   11. If you are to report a build problem with a Harbour application,
       all of the above points apply, plus make sure to use '-trace'
       command line option when running hbmk2 and redirect the result to
       a file (see above how).
       It's good idea to first remove all manual references to Harbour
       core components from makefiles and custom environment. F.e. it's
       commom mistake to add C compiler header and/or lib dirs, Harbour core
       header and/or lib dirs, built-in constants to makefiles or environment.
       No such thing is necessary as all of these are automatically handled
       by hbmk2. IOW start simple and don't be overbusy with "fine-tuning"
       your configuration. If you need to, the problem is most probably
       elsewhere. It's also good idea to try with Harbour nightly binary or
       official stable release first.
   12. If you are to report a problem with Harbour itself, always provide
       self-contained, minimal source code example. Do not use xhb contrib
       library, or any 3rd party Harbour libraries. The example shall reproduce
       the problem using official stable or nightly Harbour build.
       Do not post executables and other binary files. If your source contains
       non-ASCII (national, accented, special) chars, clearly mark the
       codepage/encoding used and attach the files compressed with zip.
       (use the extension '.zip')
       See more on self-contained examples: http://sscce.org/
   13. If your example involves compatibility components, make sure to test
       it against original implementation (for example, test legacy Clipper
       core language elements against real CA-Clipper 5.2e or 5.3b, or hbct
       functions against CT3 library, etc.)


11. QUICK START TO BUILD YOUR OWN HARBOUR APPLICATIONS
======================================================

   For all platforms you'll need two things:

   * Harbour binaries

       Either a Harbour binary distribution or a local Harbour
       build will be okay. If you're reading this text, it's
       very likely you have one of these already.

   * Supported ANSI C compiler

       Your compiler of choice has to be placed in the PATH
       (and configured appropriately according to instructions).
       If you use official Harbour binary distribution on Windows,
       you already have MinGW compiler embedded in the installation,
       which will automatically be used, so you don't have to
       make any extra steps here.

   Examples to start with Harbour:

   - To run the interactive shell ('dot' prompt):
       'hbmk2 .'
   - To run a Harbour script:
       'hbmk2 script.hb [<parameters>]'

   Examples to build and run Harbour portable binary (aka precompiled script):

   - To build:
       'hbmk2 -gh script.hb'
   - To run result of above:
       'hbmk2 script.hrb [<parameters>]'

   Examples to build a Harbour application:

   - To build one simple .prg:
       'hbmk2 hello.prg'
   - To build multiple .prg sources into one application:
       'hbmk2 mymain.prg client.prg'
   - To build an application using a project file:
       'hbmk2 myapp.hbp'
   - To build an application using incremental mode:
       'hbmk2 myapp.hbp -inc'
   - To build an application which uses a library:
       'hbmk2 myapp.prg -lmylib -L<path_to_mylib>'
   - To build an application which uses a contrib package or
     3rd party package that provides an .hbc file:
       'hbmk2 myapp.prg hbct.hbc'
   - To build an application which uses Windows resources:
       'hbmk2 mymain.prg client.prg myres.rc'
   - To build an application which links against Harbour dynamic libraries:
       'hbmk2 -shared hello.prg'
   - To build an application out of all .prg and .c sources residing
     in 'source' subdir:
       'hbmk2 -omyapp src/*.prg src/*.c'

   Examples to build a Harbour static library:

   - To build library 'mylib' from sources:
       'hbmk2 mylibsrc.prg -omylib -hblib'
   - To build library 'mylib' from sources using incremental mode:
       'hbmk2 mylibsrc.prg -omylib -hblib -inc'

   NOTES: - Most of the above features can be combined. F.e. to use
            incremental build in any of the above commands, just add
            '-inc' switch.
          - List all available options:
            'hbmk2 -help'
            Besides the ones listed, you can use all regular Harbour
            compiler command line options, f.e.:
               '-l', '-b', '-n', '-w3' (etc...)
          - To make it easier to work with Harbour, it's recommended to
            put Harbour binary directory into the PATH:
               set PATH=C:\harbour\bin;%PATH% (on Windows)
            (this is not a requirement though)
          - You can access hbmk2 using absolute or relative paths, and
            it will work equally well:
               'C:\hb\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg'
          - GNU Make, MSYS, or any other extra tool is *not* needed
            to build a Harbour application with above methods.

14. HOW TO PARTICIPATE
======================

   There are several ways to help making Harbour better:

   - You can give feedback/suggestions to developers on available
     channels.
   - You can submit patches or source code on above channels.
     Patches are accepted in 'svn diff' (or 'diff -u') format,
     created from root directory of the repository sandbox.
     Zip your patch file before attaching it. Use the extension '.zip'.
     Always use the same coding/formatting style as you find in
     the files you're patching.
   - In the rare case you need to send something large (> 100KB),
     use this free service: http://dropcanvas.com
   - Given a good history of valuable contributions, you can get
     write access to the source repository.
   - Of course there is more into Harbour contribution than writing
     code, so you're welcome to do so in other areas like documentation,
     helping fellow users, giving input on decisions, testing in
     various environments, etc.
