 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *     FT_ISBITON()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *     String
 *  $ONELINER$
 *     Determine the state of individual bits in a number
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *     FT_ISBITON( <nNumber>, <nBit> ) -> lResult
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *     <nNumber> is an integer for which a bit state needs to be checked.
 *
 *     <nBit> is a number from 0 to 15 that indicates which bit to test.
 *  $RETURNS$
 *     .T. if the specified bit was on., .F. if off.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *     This function is useful when dealing with binary integers.  It will
 *     come in very handy if you use the FT_INT86() function, because the
 *     CPU flags are returned as a series of bits.  Using this function, you
 *     can determine the state of each CPU flag.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *     IF FT_ISBITON( nCPUFlags, 0 )
 *        ? "The carry flag was set."
 *     ENDIF
 *
 *     IF FT_ISBITON( nCPUFlags, 7 )
 *        ? "The sign flag was set."
 *     ENDIF
 *  $END$
