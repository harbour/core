 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *     FT_DATECNFG()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *     Date/Time
 *  $ONELINER$
 *     Set beginning of year/week for FT_ date functions
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *     FT_DATECNFG( [ <cFYStart> ], [ <nDow> ] ) -> aDateInfo
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *     <cFYStart> is a character date string in the user's system date
 *     format, i.e., the same as the user would enter for CTOD().  If
 *     this argument is NIL, the current value is unchanged.
 *
 *     Note: The year portion of the date string must be present and
 *     be a valid year; however, it has no real meaning.
 *
 *     <nDow> is a number from 1 to 7 (1 = Sunday) indicating the
 *     desired start of a work week.  If this argument is NIL,
 *     the current value is unchanged.
 *
 *  $RETURNS$
 *     A 2-element array containing the following information:
 *
 *        aDateInfo[1] - an ANSI date string indicating the beginning
 *                       date of the year.  Only the month and day are
 *                       meaningful.
 *
 *        aDateInfo[2] - the number of the first day of the week
 *                       (1 = Sunday)
 *
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *     FT_DATECNFG() is called internally by many of the date functions
 *     in the library to determine the beginning of year date and
 *     beginning of week day.
 *
 *     The default beginning of the year is January 1st and the default
 *     beginning of the week is Sunday (day 1).  Either or both of these
 *     settings may be changed by calling FT_DATECNFG() with the proper
 *     arguments.  They will retain their values for the duration of the
 *     program or until they are changed again by a subsequent call to
 *     FT_DATECNFG().
 *
 *     It is not necessary to call FT_DATECNFG() unless you need to
 *     change the defaults.
 *
 *     FT_DATECNFG() affects the following library functions:
 *
 *       FT_WEEK()       FT_ACCTWEEK()       FT_DAYTOBOW()
 *       FT_MONTH()      FT_ACCTMONTH()      FT_DAYOFYR()
 *       FT_QTR()        FT_ACCTQTR()        FT_ACCTADJ()
 *       FT_YEAR()       FT_ACCTYEAR()
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *       // Configure library date functions to begin year on
 *       //  July 1st.
 *
 *       FT_DATECNFG( "07/01/80" )    // year is insignificant
 *
 *       // Examples of return values:
 *
 *       //  System date format: American            aArray[1]    aArray[2]
 *
 *       aArray := FT_DATECNFG()                //  "1980.01.01"     1 (Sun.)
 *       aArray := FT_DATECNFG( "07/01/80" )    //  "1980.07.01"     1 (Sun.)
 *       aArray := FT_DATECNFG( "07/01/80", 2 ) //  "1980.07.01"     2 (Mon.)
 *       aArray := FT_DATECNFG( , 2 )           //  "1980.01.01"     2 (Mon.)
 *
 *       //  System date format: British
 *
 *       aArray := FT_DATECNFG( "01/07/80", 2 ) //  "1980.07.01"     2 (Mon.)
