   $CATEGORY$
      File I/O

      Browse a text file
   $SYNTAX$
      FT_DISPFILE() -> cExitkey
   $ARGUMENTS$
      None
   $RETURNS$
      The ASCII keystroke that terminated FT_DISPFILE()
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This routine displays a text file within a defined window using as
      little memory as possible.  The text file to display has to be
      present or an error value of 0 is returned (as a character.)
  
      Assumptions: The routine assumes that all lines are terminated
                   with a CR/LF sequence (0x0d and 0x0a).
  
      Note:        Make sure you allocate a buffer large enough to hold
                   enough data for the number of lines that you have
                   in the window.  Use the following formula as a
                   guideline - buffer size = (# of line) + 1 * RMargin
                   this is the smallest you should make the buffer and
                   for normal use I recommend 4096 bytes.
  
      Cursor Keys: Up, Down    - moves the highlight line
                   Left, Right - moves the window over nColSkip col's
                   Home        - moves the window to the far left
                   End         - moves the window to the nRMargin column
                   PgUp, PgDn  - moves the highlight one page
                   Ctrl-PgUp   - moves the highlight to the file top
                   Ctrl-PgDn   - moves the highlight to the file bottom
                   Ctrl-Right  - moves the window 16 col's to the right
                   Ctrl-Left   - moves the window 16 col's to the left
  
                   Esc, Return - terminates the function
  
                   All other keys are ignored unless they are specified
                   within cExitKeys parameter.  This list will tell the
                   routine what keys terminate the function.  Special
                   keys must be passed by a unique value and that value
                   can be found by looking in the keys.h file.

      cKey := FT_DISPFILE()
  
      FT_DFCLOSE()
  
      @ 20, 0 SAY "Key that terminated FT_DISPFILE() was: " + "[" + cKey + "]"
