      Save a screen region for later display
   $SYNTAX$
      FT_SAVRGN( <nTop>, <nLeft>, <nBottom>, <nRight> ) -> cScreen
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nTop>, <nLeft>, <nBottom>, and <nRight> define the portion of the
      screen to save.  Allowable values are 0 through 255.
   $RETURNS$
      FT_SAVRGN() returns the saved screen region and its coordinates
      as a character string.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      FT_SAVRGN() is similar to Clipper's SAVESCREEN(), but it saves the
      screen coordinates as well as the display information.  The saved
      area can be restored by passing the returned string to FT_RSTRGN().

      Note that the strings returned from FT_SAVRGN() and Clipper's
      SAVESCREEN() are not interchangeable.  A screen region saved with
      with FT_SAVRGN() must be restored using FT_RSTRGN().

      FT_SAVRGN() calls Clipper's SAVESCREEN().  Refer to the Clipper
      documentation for more information regarding this function.
   $EXAMPLES$
      // The following example uses FT_SAVRGN() and FT_RSTRGN() to save
      // and restore a portion of the screen.

      @ 0, 0, 24, 79 BOX "111111111"          // fill the screen with 1's
      cScreen := FT_SAVRGN( 10, 10, 20, 30 )  // save a region
      @ 0, 0, 24, 79 BOX "222222222"          // fill the screen with 2's
      FT_RSTRGN( cScreen )                    // restore the 1's region

      Restore region of the screen saved with FT_SAVRGN()
   $SYNTAX$
      FT_RSTRGN( <cScreen>, [ <nTop> ], [ <nLeft> ] ) -> NIL
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cScreen> is a screen region previously returned from FT_SAVRGN().

      <nTop> and <nLeft> are optional parameters that define a new location
      for the upper left corner of the screen area contained in <cScreen>.
      Allowable values are 0 through 255.
   $RETURNS$
      FT_RSTRGN() returns NIL.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      FT_RSTRGN() restores a screen region previously saved with
      FT_SAVRGN().  Calling FT_RSTRGN() with <cScreen> as the only
      parameter will restore the saved region to its original location.
      <nTop> and <nLeft> may be used to define a new location for the
      upper left corner of the saved region.

      <nTop> and <nLeft> are dependent upon each other. You may not
      specify one without the other.

      FT_RSTRGN() calls Clipper's RESTSCREEN().  Refer to the Clipper
      documentation for more information regarding this function.
   $EXAMPLES$
      // The following example uses FT_RSTRGN() to restore a saved portion
      // of the screen to different locations.

      cScreen := FT_SAVRGN( 10, 10, 20, 30 ) // save a region
      @ 0, 0, 24, 79 BOX "222222222"         // fill the screen with 2's

      @ 0, 0, 24, 79 BOX "222222222"         // fill the screen with 2's
      FT_RSTRGN( cScreen, 20, 60 )           // restore to a different location

      FT_RGNSTACK()
   $CATEGORY$
      Video
   $ONELINER$
      Push or pop a saved screen region on or off the stack
   $SYNTAX$
      FT_RGNSTACK( <cAction>, [ <nTop> ], [ <nLeft> ], [ <nBottom> ],
         [ <nRight> ] ) -> NIL
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cAction> determines what action FT_RGNSTACK() will take.  The
      allowable values for this parameter are "push", "pop", and "pop all".
      If the function is called with any other string as the first parameter
      no action is performed.

      <cAction> with a value of "push" will push a saved screen region onto
      the stack.  A value of "pop" will restore the most recently pushed
      screen region.  "pop all" tells the function to restore all screen
      images which are currently on the stack.

      The use of <nTop>, <nLeft>, <nBottom>, and <nRight> depends on the
      <cAction> parameter.  If <cAction> is "push", the next four parameters
      define the screen region to save.  If <cAction> is "pop" or "pop all"
      the following four parameters are ignored.
   $RETURNS$
      FT_RGNSTACK() returns NIL.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      FT_RGNSTACK() allows multiple screens to be saved and restored from
      a stack.  The stack is implemented with Clipper static array that is
      visible only to FT_RGNSTACK().

      The purpose of FT_RGNSTACK() is to allow multiple screen regions to be
      managed without the need to remember the original coordinates or to
      create variables for each one.

      When called with "push", FT_RGNSTACK() places the saved screen area
      at the end of the static array.  The array size is incremented by one
      to accommodate the new screen area.

      When called with "pop", the function restores the screen image stored
      in the last element of the array, and the array size is decremented by
      one.  If "pop all" is specified, all the saved screens are restored
      until the array is empty.

      FT_RGNSTACK() calls FT_SAVRGN() and FT_RSTRGN().  Refer to the
      documentation for these two functions for more information.
   $EXAMPLES$
      // The following example uses FT_RGNSTACK() to save and restore various
      // sections of the screen.

      @ 0, 0, 24, 79 BOX "111111111"             // fill the screen with 1's
      FT_RGNSTACK( "push", 10,  5, 15, 15 )      // push a region
      @ 0, 0, 24, 79 BOX "222222222"             // fill the screen with 2's
      FT_RGNSTACK( "push", 10, 20, 15, 30 )      // push a region
      @ 0, 0, 24, 79 BOX "333333333"             // fill the screen with 3's
