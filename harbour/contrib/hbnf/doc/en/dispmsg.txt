      Display a message and optionally waits for a keypress
   $SYNTAX$
      FT_DISPMSG( <aMessageArray>, [ <cKey2Check> ],
                  [ <nTopBoxRow> ], [ <nLeftBoxColumn> ],
                  [ <cnBoxType> ], [ <lShadow> ] ) -> lKeyMatch
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <aMessageArray> is a multidimensional array of messages to be
      displayed and the color attributes for each message.
  
      The first dimension of the array contains one or more elements,
      each representing one line in the message box, up to the maximum
      number of rows on the screen.
  
      Within each line of the message individual characters or groups
      of characters may be delimited with braces ([]).  The braces will
      be stripped out and the character(s) inside those braces will be
      highlighted.
  
      The second dimension of the array contains a color attribute for
      the corresponding element in dimension one, plus one additional
      element for the color of the box border.  Dimension two will
      always contain one more element than dimension one.  If an
      attribute is omitted, the last color selected will be used.
  
      <Key2Check> is a character string of one or more keys to check
      for.  If omitted, the message is displayed and control is returned
      to the calling procedure.  If one character is specified,
      FT_DISPMSG() waits for one keypress, restores the screen and
      returns.  If multiple characters are specified, FT_DISPMSG()
      remains in a loop until one of the specified keys has been
      pressed, then restores the screen and returns.
  
      <nTopBoxRow> is the upper row for the message box.  If omitted, the
      box is centered vertically.
  
      <nLeftBoxColumn> is the leftmost column for the box.  If omitted, the
      box is centered horizontally.
  
      <cnBoxType> is a string of characters or a variable for the box
      border.  See the DISPBOX() function.  If omitted, a double box is
      drawn.
  
      <lShadow> is a logical variable.  If true (.T.) or omitted, it
      uses FT_SHADOW() to add a transparent shadow to the box.  If
      false (.F.), the box is drawn without the shadow.
   $RETURNS$
      If <Key2Check> is not specified, FT_DISPMSG() will return false
      (.F.).
  
      If <Key2Check> is a one-character string, FT_DISPMSG() will return
      true (.T.) if the user presses that key, or false (.F.) if any
      other key is pressed.
  
      If <Key2Check> consists of multiple characters, it will lock the
      user in a loop until one of those keys are pressed and return the
      INKEY() value of the keypress.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      FT_DISPMSG() is a multi-purpose pop-up for user messages.
      Multiple lines may be displayed, each with a different attribute.
      The box will be automatically centered on the screen, or the row
      and/or column can be specified by the programmer.  It also centers
      each line of the message within the box.
   $EXAMPLES$
      The following example displays a simple two-line message
      and returns immediately to the calling routine.
  
         FT_DISPMSG( { { "Printing Report"                    , ;
                         "Press [ESC] To Interrupt" }         , ;
                       { "W+/B*", "W/B", "GR+/B" } } )
  
      The next example displays a message and waits for a key press.
  
         FT_DISPMSG( { { "Press [D] To Confirm Deletion"      , ;
                         "Or Any Other Key To Abort" }        , ;
                       { "W+/B", "W+/B", "GR+/B" } }          , ;
                       "D" )
  
      The next example displays a one-line message centered on row 5
      and returns to the calling procedure.
  
         FT_DISPMSG( { { "Please Do Not Interrupt" }   , ;
                       { "W+/B", "GR+/B" } }           , ;
                       , 5, )
   $END$
