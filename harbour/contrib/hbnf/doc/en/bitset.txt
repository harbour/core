   $FUNCNAME$
      FT_BITSET()
   $CATEGORY$
      String
   $ONELINER$
      Set selected bit in a byte
   $SYNTAX$
      FT_BITSET( <cByte>, <nBitPos> ) -> cByte
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cByte> is a character from Chr(0) to Chr(255).

      <nBitPos> is a number from 0 to 7 conforming to standard right-to-left
      bit numbering convention and representing the position of the bit
      within the byte.
   $RETURNS$
      Returns new byte, with designated bit set.  If parameters are faulty,
      returns NIL.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      In effect, ORs argument byte with a byte that has only the target bit
      set.  If bit is already set, it remains set.
      Note: Calls FT_ISBIT() which is also in this Library.

      This function is presented to illustrate that bit-wise operations
      are possible with Clipper code.  For greater speed, write .c or
      .asm versions and use the Clipper Extend system.
   $EXAMPLES$
      This code would set bit 4 in a byte represented by Chr( 107 ):

           cNewbyte := FT_BITSET( Chr( 107 ), 4 )
           ? Asc( cNewbyte )             // result: 123
           ? cNewbyte                    // result: "{"


      This code would set bit 5 in the byte represented by the letter "A".

           ? FT_BITSET( "A", 5 )         // result: "a"
                                         // bit 5 set
   $SEEALSO$
      FT_BITCLR() FT_ISBIT()
   $END$
