 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *     FT_ROUND()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *     Math
 *  $ONELINER$
 *     Rounds a number to a specific place
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *     FT_ROUND( <nNumber> [, <nRoundToAmount>           ;
 *               [, <cRoundType>  [, <cRoundDirection>   ;
 *               [, <nAcceptableError> ] ] ] ] )            -> nNumber
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *     <nNumber> is the number to round
 *
 *     <nRoundToAmount> is the fraction to round to or the number of places,
 *     default is 2.
 *
 *     <cRoundType> is the type of rounding desired
 *
 *        "D" for Decimal       (3 for thousandth, 1/1000)  (default)
 *        "F" for Fraction      (3 for thirds, 1/3)
 *        "W" for Whole numbers (3 for thousand, 1000)
 *
 *     <cRoundDirection> is the direction to round the number toward
 *
 *        "U" to round Up      1.31 ->  1.4
 *                            -1.31 -> -1.4
 *        "D" to round Down    1.36 ->  1.3
 *                            -1.36 -> -1.3
 *        "N" to round Normal  1.5  ->  2
 *                            -1.5  -> -2
 *                             1.49 ->  1
 *                            -1.49 -> -1
 *
 *     <nAcceptableError> is the amount that is considered acceptable
 *     to be within, i.e., if you're within this amount of the number
 *     you don't need to round
 *  $RETURNS$
 *     The number, rounded as specified.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *     This function will allow you to round a number.  The following can
 *     be specified:
 *       a. Direction (up, down or normal - normal is 4/5 convention)
 *       b. Type (whole, decimal, fraction)
 *       c. Amount (100's, 5 decimals, 16th, etc.)
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *     // round normal to 2 decimal places
 *     nDollars := FT_ROUND( nDollars )
 *
 *     // round normal to 6 decimal places
 *     nIntRate := FT_ROUND( nIntRate, 6 )
 *
 *     // round to nearest thousands
 *     nPrice   := FT_ROUND( nPrice, 3, NEAREST_WHOLE_NUMBER )
 *
 *     // round Up to nearest third
 *     nAmount  := FT_ROUND( nAmount, 3, NEAREST_FRACTION, ROUND_UP )
 *
 *     // round down to 3 decimals Within .005
 *     nAvg     := FT_ROUND( nAvg, 3, , ROUND_DOWN, .005 )
 *  $END$
