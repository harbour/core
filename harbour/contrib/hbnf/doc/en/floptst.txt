      FT_FLOPTST()
   $CATEGORY$
      DOS/BIOS
   $ONELINER$
      Test diskette drive status
   $SYNTAX$
      FT_FLOPTST( <nDrive> ) -> nStatus
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nDrive> is the diskette drive number, 0 = A:, 1 = B:
   $RETURNS$
      -1 - Wrong Parameters
       0 - Drive Loaded and ready to read or write
       1 - Drive Door Open or Diskette inserted upside down
       2 - Diskette is unformatted
       3 - Write protected
       4 - Undetermined
   $DESCRIPTION$
      FT_FLOPTST() is designed as a full replacement for ISDRIVE().  Where
      ISDRIVE() returns just .T. or .F. depending if the diskette drive is
      ready or not, FT_FLOPTST() returns a numeric code designating the
      diskette drive's status.

      FT_FLOPTST() is particularly useful in backup and restore programs
      that need to test the floppy drive before writing/reading from a
      floppy disk.

      No testing has been performed on systems with more than 2 floppy
      drives.  If the third drive is "C" and the fourth "D" then there
      should be no problems.

      This function does not currently check subst'd drives.  So if you
      have SUBST E: A:\ then FT_FLOPTST( Asc( "E" ) - Asc( "A" ) ) == 4
      Any suggestions to fix this limitation are appreciated.

   $EXAMPLES$
      iStatus := FT_FLOPTST( 0 )
      DO CASE
      CASE iStatus == 1
         ? "The door to drive A is open."
      CASE iStatus == 2
         ? "The diskette in drive A is not formatted."
      CASE iStatus == 3
         ? "The diskette in drive A is write-protected."
      CASE iStatus == 4
         ? "Something is wrong with drive A, but I don't know what."
      ENDCASE
   $END$
