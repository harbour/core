      FT_LINKED()
   $CATEGORY$
      Environment
   $ONELINER$
      Determine if a function was linked in
   $SYNTAX$
      FT_LINKED( <cString> ) -> lResult
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cString> is a character string containing one or more function
                calls
   $RETURNS$
      .T. if all functions within the string are currently linked into
      the application, .F. if one or more aren't.  See below for a
      definition of "function."
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function would be used in data driven application to determine
      whether or not a macro compiled function was linked in.
  
      Several functions can be passed, and nested, in <cString>.
  
      Caveat: Some function calls are converted by the preprocessor
      into other function calls. You cannot have these types of
      functions in a macro compiled string as they never exist at
      runtime. FT_LINKED will correctly tell you that they are invalid.
  
      For instance: there is no function called SORT() in any of the
      Nantucket LIBraries, but it is a valid CLIPPER command because the
      preprocessor will convert it to other function calls.
  
  
   $EXAMPLES$
      cString := "FT_GoodFunc( BadFunc( 3, 2 ) )"
      IF FT_LINKED( cString )
         Eval( &( "{||" + cString + "}" ) )
      ELSE
         Alert( "Error: " + cString + " was not linked in. Called by FT_LINKED()" )
      ENDIF
   $END$
