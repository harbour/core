   $SYNTAX$
      FT_ACCTQTR( [ <dGivenDate> ], [ <nQtrNum> ] ) -> aDateinfo
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <dGivenDate> is any valid date in any date format.  Defaults
      to current system date if not supplied.
  
      <nQtrNum> is a number from 1 to 4 signifying a quarter.
      Defaults to current quarter if not supplied.
   $RETURNS$
      A three element array containing the following data:
  
         aDateInfo[ 1 ] - The year and qtr. as a character string "YYYYQQ"
         aDateInfo[ 2 ] - The beginning date of the accounting quarter
         aDateInfo[ 3 ] - The ending date of the accounting quarter
   $DESCRIPTION$
      FT_ACCTQTR() creates an array containing data about the
      accounting quarter containing the given date.
  
      An accounting period has the following characteristics:
  
      If the first week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
      days, it is included in the period; otherwise, the first
      week was included in the prior period.
  
      If the last week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
      days it is included in the period; otherwise, the last week
      is included in the next period.  This results in 13 week
      'quarters' and 4 or 5 week 'months'.  Every 5 or 6 years, a
      'quarter' will contain 14 weeks and the year will contain 53
      weeks.
   $EXAMPLES$
      // get info about accounting month containing 9/15/90
      aDateInfo := FT_ACCTQTR( SToD( "19900915" ) )
      ? aDateInfo[ 1 ]   //  199003       (3rd quarter)
      ? aDateInfo[ 2 ]   //  07/01/90     beginning of quarter 3
      ? aDateInfo[ 3 ]   //  09/29/90     end of quarter 3
  
      // get info about accounting qtr. 2 in year containing 9/15/90
      aDateInfo := FT_ACCTQTR( SToD( "19900915" ), 2 )
      ? aDateInfo[ 1 ]   //  199002
      ? aDateInfo[ 2 ]   //  04/01/89   beginning of quarter 2
      ? aDateInfo[ 3 ]   //  06/30/90   end of quarter 2
