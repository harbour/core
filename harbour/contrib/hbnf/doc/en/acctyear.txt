 *  $CATEGORY$
 *     Date/Time
 *  $ONELINER$
 *     Return accounting year data
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *     FT_ACCTYEAR( [ <dGivenDate> ] ) -> aDateInfo
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *     <dGivenDate> is any valid date in any date format.  Defaults
 *     to current system date if not supplied.
 *  $RETURNS$
 *     A three element array containing the following data:
 *
 *        aDateInfo[ 1 ] - The year as a character string "YYYY"
 *        aDateInfo[ 2 ] - The beginning date of the accounting year
 *        aDateInfo[ 3 ] - The ending date of the accounting year
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *     FT_ACCTYEAR() creates an array containing data about the
 *     accounting year containing the given date.
 *
 *     An accounting period has the following characteristics:
 *
 *     If the first week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
 *     days, it is included in the period; otherwise, the first
 *     week was included in the prior period.
 *
 *     If the last week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
 *     days it is included in the period; otherwise, the last week
 *     is included in the next period.  This results in 13 week
 *     'quarters' and 4 or 5 week 'months'.  Every 5 or 6 years, a
 *     'quarter' will contain 14 weeks and the year will contain 53
 *     weeks.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *     // get info about accounting year containing 9/15/90
 *     aDateInfo := FT_ACCTYEAR( SToD( "19900915" ) )
 *     ? aDateInfo[ 1 ]   //  1990
 *     ? aDateInfo[ 2 ]   //  12/31/89    beginning of year
 *     ? aDateInfo[ 3 ]   //  12/29/90    end of year
