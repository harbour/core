 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *     FT_SCANCODE()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *     Keyboard/Mouse
 *  $ONELINER$
 *     Wait for keypress and return keyboard scan code
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *     FT_SCANCODE() -> cCode
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *     None
 *  $RETURNS$
 *     A two-character string, corresponding to the keyboard scan code.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *     FT_SCANCODE() enables you to distinguish the different scancodes
 *     of similar keys (such as Grey minus versus regular minus), thus
 *     increasing the number of keys your input routine can recognize.
 *
 *     It works like INKEY(), in that it waits for a key to be pressed.
 *     The scan code consists of two bytes, which are returned as a
 *     two-character string.
 *
 *     For example, calling FT_SCANCODE() and pressing the Grey-minus
 *     key will return a two character string:
 *
 *            Chr( 45 ) + Chr( 74 )
 *
 *     LASTKEY() is not updated by FT_SCANCODE(), so don't try to
 *     test LASTKEY() to see what was pressed during an FT_SCANCODE()
 *     call.  Simply assign the return value to a variable and test
 *     that (see the test driver below).
 *
 *     *  This was adapted from a short C routine posted by John Kaster on
 *        NANFORUM.  It was written in Clipper to help demonstrate the
 *        FT_INT86 function of the Nanforum Toolkit.
 *
 *     This program requires FT_INT86().
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      cKey := FT_SCANCODE()
 *
 *      [grey-] returns:  Chr( 45 ) + Chr( 74 )
 *      [-]     returns:  Chr( 45 ) + Chr( 12 )
 *      [grey+] returns:  Chr( 43 ) + Chr( 78 )
 *      [+]     returns:  Chr( 43 ) + Chr( 13 )
 *  $END$
