 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *     FT_PROPER()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *     String
 *  $ONELINER$
 *     Convert a string to proper-name case
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *     FT_PROPER( <cString> ) -> cProperName
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *     <cString> is the string to be converted.
 *  $RETURNS$
 *     A string of the same length as <cString>, only converted to
 *     proper name case (upper/lower case).
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *     FT_PROPER() uses a brute-force algorithm to convert a string
 *     to propername case.  First, it capitalizes the first letter of
 *     all words starting after a blank, dash, or apostrophe.  This
 *     catches most names, including special cases such as names
 *     beginning with O' (O'Malley, O'Reilly) and hyphenated names
 *     (such as Susan Chia-Mei Lo).
 *
 *     Next, it does a specific adjustment for words beginning in "Mc"
 *     It finds the first 'Mc' and capitalizes the next character after
 *     it.  It does this for all occurrences of Mc.
 *
 *     The original FT_PROPER() was written in Clipper by Glenn Scott
 *     and Mark Zechiel; it was re-written in C (and thus, optimized
 *     and enhanced) by Robert DiFalco.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *       FUNCTION main( cStr )
 *         OutStd( FT_PROPER( cStr ) + chr(13) + chr(10) )
 *       RETURN ( nil )
 *  $END$
