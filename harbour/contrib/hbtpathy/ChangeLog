   * NB: With latest commits tp_recv() and tp_recvto() wait up to
         3 ms ( under linux ) before returning ( with or without any
         character ).
         OS/2 and win32 modules, instead, return immediatly if no
         input is available and waiting in the com port receive buffer.
         I think the correct way of doing read()s is the one implemented
         in linux.c and I will change OS/2 and win32 behaviour as
         soon as I can.

   * tp_/telepath.prg
   * tp_/testtp.prg
      + Added xharbour Copyright header with full credit to the original
        author of this library

   /* I think I will change a lot this library since I want to have it
      multiplatform, so, for example, all C code will go to separated files
      (one per platform) to have a common (high level) .prg code which
      calls common (low level) C code functions from different (one per
      platform) .c files.

      As it is now should compile and work under linux, I can't test it right
      now and, probably, something will break in the process of making it
      multiplatform.

I sent the original version to the flagship website in may 2000.
I just now (July 2001) made the first change to the code.

7/19/2001
The bug I found is REALLY esoteric... it's in tp_open.  It comes into play
when something previously set the parity to Even or Odd and then your telepathy program does a tp_open on that port and sets parity to None.  I previously
assumed that if you were setting parity to N, the port was already at N and I
didn't explicitly call stty -parenb and -parodd.

I included telepathy.bak in case you care to look at the prior version.
