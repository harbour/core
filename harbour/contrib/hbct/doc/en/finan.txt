      Future value of a capital
   $SYNTAX$
      FV( nDeposit, nInterest, nPeriods ) --> nFutureValue
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nDeposit>     amount of money invested per period
      <nInterest>    rate of interest per period, 1 == 100%
      <nPeriods>     period count
   $RETURNS$
      <nFutureValue> Total value of the capital after <nPeriods> of
                     paying <nDeposit> and <nInterest> interest being
                     paid every period and added to the capital (resulting
                     in compound interest)
   $DESCRIPTION$
      FV() calculates the value of a capital after <nPeriods> periods.
      Starting with a value of 0, every period, <nDeposit>
      (Dollars, Euros, Yens, ...) and an interest of <nInterest> for the
      current capital are added for the capital (<nInterest>=Percent/100).
      Thus, one gets the non-linear effects of compound interests:
      value in period 0 = 0
      value in period 1 = ((value in period 0)*(1+<nInterest>/100)) + <nDeposit>
      value in period 2 = ((value in period 1)*(1+<nInterest>/100)) + <nDeposit>
              etc....
      value in period <nPeriod> = ((value in period <nPeriod>-1)*(1+<nInterest>/100))< + <nDeposit>
                                = <nDeposit> * sum from i=0 to <nPeriod>-1 over (1+<nInterest>/100)^i
                                = <nDeposit> * ((1+<nInterest>/100)^n-1) / (<nInterest>/100)
   $EXAMPLES$
      // Payment of 1000 per year for 10 years at a interest rate
      // of 5 per cent per year

      PERIODS() calculates the number of periods one needs to pay back
      a loan of <nLoan> with periodical payments of <nPayment> and for a
      rate of interest <nInterest> per period.
      debt in period 0 = <nLoan>

      Note, however that in the case of nPayment <= <nLoan>*(<nInterest>/100),
      one would need infinite time to pay the loan back. The functions does
      then return -1.

   $DESCRIPTION$
      RATE() calculates the rate of interest per period for the given
      loan, payment per periods and number of periods. This is done with
      the same equation used in the PAYMENT() or PERIODS() function:

      <nPayment> = <nLoan>*(<nInterest>/100)/(1-(1+<nInterest>/100)^(-<nPeriods>))

      However, this equation can not be solved for <nInterest> in a "closed"
      manner, i.e. <nInterest> = ..., so that the result can only be estimated.

      // You get a loan of 5172.56, pay 100 back every month for
      // 5 years (60 months). The effective interest rate per
      // period (=month) is
