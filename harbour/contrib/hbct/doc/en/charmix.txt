      CHARMIX()
   $CATEGORY$
      CT3 string functions
   $ONELINER$
      Mix two strings
   $SYNTAX$
      CHARMIX( <cString1>[, <cString2>] ) --> cMixedString
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cString1>     String that will be mixed with the characters from <cString2>
      [<cString2>]   String whose characters will be mixed with the one from
                     <cString1>.
                     Default: " " (string with one space char)
   $RETURNS$
      <cMixedString> Mixed string
   $DESCRIPTION$
      The CHARMIX() function mixes the strings <cString1> and <cString2>. To
      do this it takes one character after the other alternatively from
      <cString1> and <cString2> and puts them in the output string.
      This procedure is stopped when the end of <cString1> is reached. If
      <cString2> is shorter than <cString1>, the function will start at
      the begin of <cString2> again. If on the other hand <cString2> is
      longer than <cString1>, the surplus characters will be omitted.
   $EXAMPLES$
      ? CHARMIX( "ABC", "123" )    // "A1B2C3"
      ? CHARMIX( "ABCDE", "12" )   // "A1B2C1D2E1"
      ? CHARMIX( "AB", "12345" )   // "A1B2"
      ? CHARMIX( "HELLO", " " )    //  "H E L L O "
      ? CHARMIX( "HELLO", "" )     //  "HELLO"
   $TESTS$
      CHARMIX( "ABC", "123" )  == "A1B2C3"
      CHARMIX( "ABCDE", "12" ) == "A1B2C1D2E1"
      CHARMIX( "AB", "12345" ) == "A1B2"
      CHARMIX( "HELLO", " " )  == "H E L L O "
      CHARMIX( "HELLO", "" )   == "HELLO"
   $STATUS$
      Ready
   $COMPLIANCE$
      CHARMIX() is compatible with CT3's CHARMIX().
      NOTE: CA-Tools version of CHARMIX() will hang
            if the second parameter is an empty string, this version will not.
