   $DESCRIPTION$
      The ctinit() function initializes the CT3 library.
      Identical code is declared as INIT FUNCTION, thus should be executed
      automatically at the beginning of the application, but it is a good
      idea to call it once again explicitly somewhere at the beginning of
      your program to check the initialization.

      ctinit() is a new function in Harbour's CT3 library.
