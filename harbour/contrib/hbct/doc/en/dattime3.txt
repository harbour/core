      WAITPERIOD()
   $CATEGORY$
      HBCT date and time functions
   $ONELINER$
      Pauses a specified time in increments of 1/100 seconds
   $SYNTAX$
      WAITPERIOD( [<nDelay>] ) --> lNotElapsed
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <nDelay>  Designates the waiting period at initialization in
      1/100ths of seconds.  Values from 1 to 8, 640, 000 (one day) are
      possible.
   $RETURNS$
      WAITPERIOD() returns .T., if the time span designated at initialization
      has not elapsed.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function sets a time span for a xHarbour DO WHILE loop to run.
      The function must initialize prior to the loop, since you must specify
      the <nDelay> parameter in 1/100th seconds.  Subsequently, the function
      can be implemented without a parameter for additional loop conditions.
      It returns .T., as long as the designated time span has not yet run out.

      Note

      The function notes the status of the internal timer at
      initialization.  From that point on, the initialization should always
      precede the respective DO WHILE; otherwise, the time delay is
      incorrect.  The passing of midnight (the time resets to the 0 value)
      is taken into account.
   $EXAMPLES$
      Run a loop for 5 seconds:

      WAITPERIOD( 500 )             // Initialization, 5 seconds
      DO WHILE <cond1> .AND. <cond2> .AND. WAITPERIOD()
         *...

   $FUNCNAME$
      TIMEVALID()
   $CATEGORY$
      HBCT Date and Time Functions
   $ONELINER$
      Determines whether a specIFied time is valid
   $SYNTAX$
      TIMEVALID( <cTime> ) --> lValid
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cTime>  Designates a character string that contains the time to
      test.
   $RETURNS$
      TIMEVALID() RETURNs .T. when <cTime> is a valid time; or .F. when
      <cTime> is an invalid time.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      With input that requires time manipulation, writing your own UDF to
      check time inputs was unavoidable up to now.  TIMEVALID() permits
      Complete checking of a time designation.  You can use this FUNCTION
      effectively with a VALID clause within a READ mask.

      Note

      Note the format for time designations.  There must always be
      two digits for hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths; otherwise,
      the time it is regarded as invalid.  Valid examples are "12",
      "12:59", "12:59:59", and "12:59:59:99".  By contrast, invalid
      examples are "24", "12:60", or "12:1", and/or "12:".  IF you work
      with time strings that are not completely filled and that you need to
      check with TIMEVALID(), then they must be TRIMmed prior to the use of
      TIMEVALID() (see following Examples).
   $EXAMPLES$
      Using the VALID clause with TRIM, all valid times are
      accepted, even IF no seconds or minutes are specIFied:

      cBegin := SPACE( 11 )
      @ 5, 10 SAY "Please input time for beginning work:";
      GET cBegin VALID TIMEVALID( RTRIM( cBegin ) )
      READ

      Using a VALID clause without TRIM, hours and minutes must be
      specified, so that TIMEVALID() can confirm a valid time:

      cBegin := SPACE( 5 )
      @ 5, 10 SAY "Please input time for beginning work:";
      GET cBegin VALID TIMEVALID( cBegin )
      READ

      Sets the system clock
   $SYNTAX$
      SETTIME( <cTime>, [<lMode>] ) --> lSet
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cTime>  Designates a character string that contains the time that
      is to become the system time.

      <lMode>  Designates whether the time should also be set in the
      CMOS-RAM of an AT.  The default is do not write to CMOS-RAM. Note that in
      Windows platform this adjust is automatic, therefore this parameter is
      without efect.
   $RETURNS$
      The FUNCTION RETURNs .T. when the time is set successfully.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      When you use this FUNCTION to convert the time into the system time from
      within your xHarbour application, all files acquire this time with
      each write procedure.
   $EXAMPLES$
      Set the system time in each case; but the hardware clock only
      on an AT:

      cNewTime := "10:20:00"
