1.1 Here's how to prepare for uploading to the CVS server
=========================================================
by Viktor Szakats <viktor.szakats@syenar.hu>

 1) Read the Harbour FAQ (www.harbour-project.org), monitor the mailing-list
    (http://www.harbour-project.org/faq/harbour-4.html), consult with the
    developers, make contributions. This way your chances are high to get a
    RW access to the CVS.
 2) Before uploading anything you'll need Developer (RW) status for the 
    Harbour CVS server. To get this please make a request on the list, 
    or contact the Harbour Administrators. Note that getting Developer 
    status is not an automatic process.
 3) You'll need a CVS client for your platform.
 4) You'll need an SSH client for your platform.
 5) You'll need to configure CVS and SSH for the Harbour Project.
    (see: CVS_SSH.TXT)
 6) Do a complete checkout to get the fresh source tree.

1.2 Here's how to upload your changes to the CVS server
=======================================================
by Viktor Szakats <viktor.szakats@syenar.hu>

 1) Do the changes in the source, and in parallel modify ChangeLog
 2) Go online (if needed)
 3) CVS LOGIN (if needed)
 4) CVS UPDATE
 5) Resolve all conflicts (mostly ChangeLog)
 6) Copy the last ChangeLog entry to the clipboard
 7) CVS COMMIT (starts another task on my system)
 8) New email message, paste the new ChangeLog entry
 9) Copy and paste the ChangeLog entry header to the subject after 
    "CHANGELOG: "
10) The CVS pops up a window with the changed filenames
11) Check if all the changed filenames are referred in the ChangeLog entry,
    if not, make the corrections and start again
12) Paste the ChangeLog entry header to the CVS window, save, exit
13) CVS is now uploading,
    if there are any errors, make the corrections and start again
14) Always check if the upload session ended without errors.
15) Send the email message containing the changes
16) Go offline (if needed)

Important notes:

 1) *Always* add a ChangeLog entry when committing to the CVS.
 2) When adding a new file to the CVS, always use lower case 8.3 
    filenames (*), add a CVS ID header to the file, don't use tabs 
    in the file, end the file with a newline char.
    Possibly consult other Developers about the new filename and file
    placement.
    Add the new filename to the related makefiles.
    (*) There are some exceptions: ChangeLog.*, Makefile, COPYING,
        ERRATA and TODO for example.
 3) When adding a new directory, always consult the Developers about 
    the name and placing of it. On the CVS, there's no way to completely 
    remove a directory, that's why this is important.

1.3 Here's how to format your ChangeLog entries
===============================================
by Viktor Szakats <viktor.szakats@syenar.hu>

- Always add new entries to the top of the ChangeLog file.

- Add an entry header using this format:
  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC[-|+]hhmm Your Full Name <your_email_address>

  For example: 2000-05-27 23:12 UTC+0100 Viktor Szakats <viktor.szakats@syenar.hu>

- Add a entry body which lists all filenames changed, all of
  them with full path spec. Mention the name of the changed function or
  macro. Describe what you've changed, the reasons, and other comments 
  and explanations you find useful. If the change needs some related work
  to be done by someone else (documentation, makefile), make a clear note 
  about this.
  Group the related changes into logical sections separated by empty lines.
  
  Sample:

   * dir/filenam1.txt
   + dir/filenam2.txt
   - dir/filenam3.txt
     * Changed, bla-bla
     ! Fixed
     % Optimized
     + Added
     - Removed
     ; Comment

  Note that using these specific marks is preferred although not a 
  requirement.

- Leave an empty line between the header and body and one after the body.

1.4 Here's how to use the CVS server in anonymous read-only mode
================================================================

(TODO)

1.5 Switching from anonymous access to read/write access
========================================================
by David G. Holm <Harbour@SpaceMoose.com>

1) Change your CVSROOT variable from
      :pserver:anonymous@cvs.Harbour-project.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/harbour-project
   to
      :ext:your_source_forge_ID_in_lower_case@cvs.Harbour-project.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/harbour-project

2) Set up CVS to use SSH (see cvs_ssh.txt for details).

3) Visit each and every one of the CVS subdirectories in your local
   CVS tree and change the contents of the 'Root' file from your old
   CVSROOT contents to your new CVSROOT contents.

Note: Every time you issue a CVS command, you will have to enter your
SourceForge password.

1.6 Things to do to avoid damaging the SourceForge CVS tree
===========================================================
by David G. Holm <Harbour@SpaceMoose.com>

1) Always do your Harbour development using your local CVS tree. Do not
   do your development outside your local CVS tree and then copy your
   changes into your local CVS tree to commit them, because that leads
   easily to accidentally overwriting changes made by others, because
   you didn't notice that a module that you were also working on was
   changed by someone else. By always doing Harbour development using
   your local CVS tree, changes made by others will be merged with your
   changes and you only need to recompile and retest before committing.

2) Always run 'cvs update' from the 'harbour' directory before you run
   'cvs commit'. Ideally, you should redirect the output from the update
   to a file and look at the results to confirm that you are ready to do
   a commit. Any files marked M, A or D are files that you have modified
   or are adding or deleting. Confirm that you have comments for all of
   them in your ChangeLog entry. If you see many modules marked P or U,
   then you need to recompile and retest before you commit your changes.

   If you see any conflicts reported in the update output, then you need
   to resolve them before committing. CVS is generally good at merging
   changes, so you probably won't see conflicts very often, but if you
   edit the ChangeLog file before you run 'cvs update' and other changes
   have been committed by others, then ChangeLog will have conflicts. To
   resolve those conflicts, simply remove the conflict markers. What I do
   to avoid conflicts to ChangeLog is to record my changes in changes.txt
   and then copy them into ChangeLog between the update and the commit.

1.7 How I got SSH and CVS to work together
==========================================
by David G. Holm <Harbour@SpaceMoose.com>

The trick was in how to set up the CVSROOT variable.
I did this on NT4, but it should be similar for 95/98 and OS/2.

Note: Your CVS ID is the same as your SourceForge login ID, with one
      very important difference: Any and all upper case letters are
      converted to lower case. So if your SourceForge login ID is
      MyFullName, then your CVS ID will be myfullname.

First I set up SSH, using the following steps:

1) I pointed my web browser to ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/contrib/
2) I downloaded the ssh-1.2.14-win32bin.zip file
3) I unzipped the file into a directory that was already on my PATH
4) I created a directory E:\hb-dev\ for my Harbour development CVS tree
5) I created a batch file LOGIN.BAT, in the E:\hb-dev\ directory, with
   the following commands in it:
      @echo off
      SET HOME=E:\hb-dev\
    ssh -l dholm Harbour-project.sourceforge.net
6) I ran the LOGIN batch file, which automatically created a .ssh
   directory under E:\hb-dev\, automatically accepted the key from
      SourceForge, and prompted me for my  password.
7) I entered my password and got logged into a SourceForge shell,
   thus confirming that SSH is configured properly.
8) I entered "exit" to quit back to the DOS prompt.

Next I set up CVS, using the following steps:

1) I pointed my browser to http://download.cyclic.com/pub/cvs-1.10/windows/
2) I downloaded the cvs-1.10-win.zip file
3) I renamed my old CVS.EXE to CVS-OLD.EXE
4) I unzipped the new file into a directory that was already on my PATH
5) I created a batch file CHECKOUT.BAT, in my E:\hb-dev\ directory,
      with the following commands in it:
      @echo off
      SET HOMEDRIVE=E:
      SET HOMEPATH=/hb-dev/
      SET CVSROOT=:ext:dholm@cvs.Harbour-project.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/harbour-project
      SET CVS_RSH=ssh
      cvs co harbour
6) I ran the CHECKOUT batch file and was prompted for my SourceForge
   password. And it checked out the entire harbour CVS tree!

So all you have to do is make the obvious substitions for drive letters,
path names, and user IDs, and this procedure should work for you.
You may not even have to download a new copy of CVS, but you may
have to have a text mode version of SSH.

I found the trick to setting up the CVSROOT properly by doing a search for
"CVS SSH NT" at http://www.google.com/ and following the third link, named
"Configuring WinCVS and Secure SHell on Windows NT" and located at
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/RWL/Projects/scenicview/Web/cvs-ssh-config.html

1.8 How to add CVS ID to new files
==================================
by Maurilio Longo <maurilio.longo@libero.it>

When a new file is added to cvs tree it has not a CVS ID.
CVS IDs look like this:

/*
 * $Id$
 */


To add one to a file lacking it simply put as first lines:

/*
 * Chr(36) + "Id" + Chr(36)
 */

I can't write it here because cvs server would change it as soon as I
commit this file, but second line should not have Chr(36) but $ signs
and no spaces between dollar sign and Id.

as soon as you commit your file cvs ID string will be expanded
by cvs server to full length.

Note that last dollar sign is mandatory.
