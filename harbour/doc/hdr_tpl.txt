       Date functions

       Test if a date falls in a leap year.
   $SYNTAX$
       IsLeapYr( [<dDate>] ) --> <lIsLeap>
   $ARGUMENTS$
       <dDate> is an optional date. If not supplied is defaults to the

   $RETURNS$
       .T. if <dDate> falls in a leap year, .F. if not.
   $DESCRIPTION$
       IsLeapYr() can be used to check if a given year is a leap year.
   $EXAMPLES$
       /* Check if it's a leap year. */

       IF IsLeapYr()
          ? "One extra day before you get paid this Feb!!"

   $COMPLIANCE$
       IsLeapYr() works exactly like CA-Cl*pper's IsLeapYr(), if your
       CA-Cl*pper doesn't have such a function you're probably in a
       different universe from the author of this function.
