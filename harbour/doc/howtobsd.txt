HOW TO CONFIGURE BSD TO BUILD HARBOUR
-------------------------------------

First, you'll need a FreeBSD 4.4 developer installation. Then you'll need
to install bison and gmake. If you installed the ports collection, then all
you need to do to install bison and gmake is to run the following commands,
which may require that you run su first to get the correct permissions.

   cd /usr/ports/devel/bison
   make
   make install
   make clean
   cd /usr/ports/devel/gmake
   make
   make install
   make clean

If you want to use the GTSLN library instead of GTSTD or GTCRS, then you
also need to install libslang. If you installed the ports collection, then
all you need to do to install libslang is to run the following commands,
which may require that you run su first to get the correct permissions.

   cd /usr/ports/devel/libslang
   make
   make install
   make clean

Then read the doc/gmake.txt file for generic GNU make instructions and the
specific Harbour settings needed for BSD. When you want to build Harbour,
be sure to run 'gmake -r' at the command line instead of 'make -r'.
