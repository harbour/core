Notes by Scott Johnson <scomps at purplewire.org>
-------------------------------------------------

Ok, I finally got something to run.  The code I compiled was standard
Clipper 5.2 code pulled directly from a dos/win box and was working
properly there.

I'm compiling under Debian Sarge which for their own reasons are using
the Alpha Build 44.0.  It was installed with the standard apt-get
harbour.  I did this to pretty much ensure that the install wasn't
tainted by any of my previous attempts at getting this to work.

The first thing I checked was for the bld.sh.  it didn't exist so I did
the cut/paste thing from this list (thank you) and set out on my
adventure.

First off, set your environment variables.  If you want to set this up
for your shell to do it automagically go for it.  That's beyond what I
want to cover here.

export HB_ARCHITECTURE=linux
export HB_BIN_INSTALL=/usr/bin
export HB_LIB_INSTALL=/usr/lib/harbour
export HB_INC_INSTALL=/usr/include/harbour
export HB_COMPILER=gcc
export HB_GT_LIB=gtcrs

Since we created the bld.sh from scratch, I dropped it in the /usr/bin
directory where the rest of the harbour binaries exist.

chmod +x bld.sh

Now I go to where my actual clipper/harbour source code is.

The files I have are inv.prg, csrc.prg, cmenu.prg and citem.prg.  The
dbf files are already created and exist in the same directory, but
that's just me.  I pulled those over with the dos application.

Next, I issued the following command

bld.sh inv csrc cmenu citem

This ran through it's gyrations, made the c source and attempted to link
it.  Hey, this is great although it bombed out with an unresolved
external to dbfdbt.  Ok, so that's a library.  I can do this

I jumped into the bld.sh file and hunted down the gcc line.  It's quite
a ways down into the file, but you'll need to find the one appropriate
for your system (mind was right after the last check for GT_LIB where it
leaves it as gtstd if you don't set something.

On the gcc line, you'll see a section like "-L$HB_LIB_INSTALL -ldebug"
and so on; add "-ldbfdbt" (without the quotes of course).  I added it
right after -lrdd, but I don't know if that's important or not. Maybe
somebody can correct me there.

After I saved it, I went back and issued the same bld.sh command as I
did above, and lo!  It just worked.

./inv

As a side note, gtstd is probably not going to be very helpful for you
in linux if you have any SAY/GET's as screen positioning (especially if
you use xterm) won't be handled correctly.  Same with gtpca.  Gtcrs
seemed to work properly in my environment.

I know this is pretty sparse as far as any kind of documentation is
concerned, and I might be doing things I don't need to, and not doing
things that make people cringe.  It's a start though and maybe some
folks can clean it up a bit and add/remove things that are important.
At least this worked on my particular Debian system.   Your mileage may
vary and other distributions will probably have their own setups and
issues.
