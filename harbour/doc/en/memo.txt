                  lives in another directory, you must include the path.

      Returns the contents of a text file as a character string.

   $DESCRIPTION$
      MEMOREAD() is a function that reads the content of a text file (till
      now) from disk (floppy, HD, CD-ROM, etc.) into a memory string.
      In that way you can manipulate as any character string or assigned
      to a memo field to be saved in a database.

      MEMOREAD() function is used together with MEMOEDIT() and MEMOWRIT()
      to get from disk text from several sources that would be edited,
      searched, replaced, displayed, etc.

      It is used to import data from other sources to our database.

      Note:
      MEMOREAD() does not use the settings SET DEFAULT or SET PATH to
      search for <cFileName>.
      It searches for <cFileName> in the current directory.

      Over a network, MEMOREAD() attempts to open <cFileName> in read-only
      mode and shared.  If the file is used in mode exclusive by another
      process, the function will returns a null string ("").
   $EXAMPLES$
      //  This example uses MEMOREAD() to assign the contents of a text
