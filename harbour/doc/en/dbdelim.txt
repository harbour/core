   $ONELINER$
      Copies the contents of a database to a delimited text file or
      appends the contents of a delimited text file to a database.
   $SYNTAX$
      __dbDelim( <lExport>, <xcFile>, [<xcDelim>], [<aFields>],
      [<bFor>], [<bWhile>], [<nNext>], [<nRecord>], <lRest>  )
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <lExport> If set to .T., copies records to a delimited file.
      If set to .F., append records from a delimited file.

      <xcFile> The name of the text file to copy to or append from.
      If a file extension is not specified, ".txt" is used by default.

      <xcDelim> Either the character to use as the character field
      delimiter (only the first character is used). or "BLANK" (not case
      sensitive), which eliminates the character field delimiters and
      sets the field separator to a single space instead of a comma.

      <aFields> An aray of field names to limit the processint to. If
      not specified, or if empty, then all fields are processed.

      <bFor> An optional code block containing a FOR expression that
      will reduce the number of records to be processed.

      <bWhile> An optional code block containing a WHILE expression
      that will reduce the number of records to be processed.

      <nNext> If present, but nRecord is not present, specifies to
      process this number of records, starting with the current record.
      A value of 0 means to process no records.

      <nRecord> If present, specifies the only record to process. A
      value of 0 means to process no records. Overrides <nNext> and <lRest>.

      <lRest> If <lExport> is .T., then if <lRest> is set to .T. and there are no
      <nRecord>, <nNext>, or <bWhile> arguments, processes all records from
      current to last.
