 *      LABEL FORM <cLabelName> [TO PRINTER] [TO FILE <cFile>] [<cScope>]
 *                 [WHILE <bWhile> ] [FOR <bFor> ] [SAMPLE] [NOCONSOLE]
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *        <cLabelName>   Name of label file
 *        <cFile>        Name of an alternate file
 *        <cScope>       Expression of a scoping condition
 *        <bWhile>       WHILE condition
 *        <bFor>         FOR condition
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      This command allows labels to be printed based on the format
 *      outlined in LBL file specified as <cLabelName>. By default, output
 *      will go to the screen however this output may be rerouted with
 *      either the TO PRINTER or the TO FILE clause.
 *
 *      If the TO FILE clause is specified, the name of the ASCII text file
 *      containing the generated labels will be <cFile>.
 *
 *      If no file extension is specified a .txt extension is added.
 *      <cScope> is the scope condition for this command. Valid scopes
 *      include NEXT <expN> (number of records to be displayed, where <expN>
 *      is the number of records), RECORD <expN> (a specific record to be
 *      printed), REST (all records starting from the current record
 *      position,and ALL (all records). The default is ALL.
 *
 *      Both logical expression may work ill conjunction with one another
 *      where <bFor> is the logical expression for the FOR condition (for
 *      records to be displayed whitin a given value range) and <bWhile> for
 *      the WHILE condition (for records to be displayed until they fail to
 *      meet the condition).
 *
 *      If the SAMPLE clause is specified, test labels will be generated.
 *
 *      If the NOCONSOLE clause is specified,the console will be turned off
 *      while this command is being executed.
 *
 *      This command follows the search criteria outlined in the SET PATH TO

 *      in <cLabelName>
