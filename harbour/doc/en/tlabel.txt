 *      This command allows labels to be printed based on the format outlined in
 *      .LBL file specified as <cLabelName>. By default, output will go to the
 *      screen however this output may be rerouted with either the TO PRINTER or
 *      the TO FILE clause.   </par>

 *      If the TO FILE clause is specified, the name of the ASCII text file
 *      containing the generated labels will be <cFile>.   </par>

 *      If no file extension is specified a .TXT extension is added.
 *      <cScope> is the scope condition for this command. Valid scopes include
 *      NEXT <expN> (number of records to be displayed, where <expN> is the number
 *      of records), RECORD <expN> (a specific record to be printed), REST (all
 *      records starting from the current record position,and ALL (all records).
 *      The default is ALL.   </par>

 *      Both logical expression may work ill conjunction with one another where
 *      <bFor> is the logical expression for the FOR condition (for records to
 *      be displayed whitin a given value range) and <bWhile> for the WHILE
 *      condition (for records to be displayed until they fail to meet the
 *      condition).   </par>
