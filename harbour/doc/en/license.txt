 *   <b>THE HARBOUR PROJECT LIBRARY LICENSE</b>  </par>
 *   ===================================  </par>
 *

 *         source directory, and subdirectories.  </par>
 *

 *
 *   As a special exception, the Harbour Project gives permission for
 *   additional uses of the text contained in its release of Harbour.  </par>
 *
 *   The exception is that, if you link the Harbour libraries with other
 *   files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
 *   resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
 *   Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of
 *   linking the Harbour library code into it.  </par>
 *
 *   This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
 *   the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.  </par>
 *
 *   This exception applies only to the code released by the Harbour
 *   Project under the name Harbour.  If you copy code from other
 *   Harbour Project or Free Software Foundation releases into a copy of
 *   Harbour, as the General Public License permits, the exception does
 *   not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid misleading
 *   anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete
 *   this exception notice from them.  </par>
 *
 *   If you write modifications of your own for Harbour, it is your choice
 *   whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
 *   If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.  </par>
 *
 *
 *   <b>THE OLD HARBOUR PROJECT LIBRARY LICENSE</b>  </par>
 *   =======================================  </par>
 *
 *   Note: This license only applies to the following files:  </par>
 *   <pre>
 *      contrib\libmisc\dates2.c (Only the DateTime() function by Jon Berg)
 *      samples\pe\*
 *      source\rtl\philes.c

 *
 *   The exception is that if you link the Harbour Runtime Library (HRL)
 *   and/or the Harbour Virtual Machine (HVM) with other files to produce
 *   an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable
 *   to be covered by the GNU General Public License. Your use of that
 *   executable is in no way restricted on account of linking the HRL
 *   and/or HVM code into it.  </par>

 *
 *
 *   <b>THE HARBOUR PROJECT CONTRIB LICENSE</b>  </par>
 *   ===================================  </par>
 *
 *   There is no one single license that applies to the Harbour Project
 *   contrib files. Some files use the Harbour Project Compiler license.
 *   Some files use the Harbour Project Library license. Some files use
 *   the old Harbour Project Library license (and in one case, just one
 *   function in a file that otherwise uses the Harbour Project Library
 *   license uses the old license - this is the DateTime() function in
 *   the file  contrib\libmisc\dates2.c).  Some files may even use other
 *   types of free software or open source  software licenses. Some files
 *   have been donated to the public domain. If you use any of the contrib
 *   files, you need to investigate the license that applies to each file.  </par>
