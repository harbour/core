      <b>The Harbour project</b>
  
      <b>************************************************************************</b>
      <b>*  This file contains information on obtaining, installing, and using  *</b>
      <b>*  Harbour. Please read it *completely* before asking for help.        *</b>
      <b>************************************************************************</b>
  
      Harbour is a free implementation of an xBase language compiler. It is
      designed to be source code compatible with the CA-Cl*pper(r) compiler.
      That means that if you've got some code that would compile using
      CA-Cl*pper(r) then it should compile under Harbour. The Harbour-Project
      web page is:
  
                   <b>http://harbour-project.org/</b>
  
      Status and other information is always available from the web site.
      There is a Harbour mailing list. Harbour is still at a very early
      stage of development, so the mailing list is very much a Developers
      only list, although every body is welcome to join in the discussions.
  
      We would like you to join the Harbour development team. If you are
      interested you may suscribe to our mailing list and start contributing
      to this free public project.
  
      Please feel free to report all questions, ideas, suggestions, fixes,
      code, etc. you may need and want. With the help of all of you, the Harbour
      compiler and runtime libraries will become a reality very soon.
  
      <b>What this distribution contains</b>
      ===============================
  
      This distribution is a Source code only distribution. It does not contain
      any executable files. Executable versions of Harbour are available from
      the web site. Executable versions of Harbour DO NOT create runable
      programs. Harbour at the moment produces C output code, which must be
      compiled with the Harbour Virtual Machine and the support libraries
      in order to create a functioning program.
      Please test running Harbour against your CA-Cl*pper source code and report
      any problems that might occur.
  
      Very important: The preprocessor functionality is now working.
  
      <b>Installation</b>
      ------------
  
      1. Unzip with Harbour zip file using pkunzip or equivalent.
  
              E.G. pkunzip -d build72.zip
  
         This will create Harbour/ directory and all the relevant sub
         directories.
  
      2. Compile Harbour using your C compiler. Make files for different
         platforms are included in the <WHERE ARE THEY?> directory.
