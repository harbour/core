 * Harbour is a free implementation of an xBase language compiler. It is
 * designed to be source code compatible with the CA-Clipper(r) compiler.
 * That means that if you've got some code that would compile using
 * CA-Clipper(r) then it should compile under Harbour. The Harbour-Project
 * web page is:   </par>
 *              <b>http://www.Harbour-Project.org/</b>   </par>
 *
 *
 * Status and other information is always available from the web site.
 * There is a Harbour mailing list. Harbour is still at a very early
 * stage of development, so the mailing list is very much a Developers
 * only list, although every body is welcome to join in the discussions.   </par>
 *
 * We would like you to join the Harbour development team. If you are
 * interested you may suscribe to our mailing list and start contributing
 * to this free public project.   </par>
 *
 * Please feel free to report all questions, ideas, suggestions, fixes,
 * code, etc. you may need and want. With the help of all of you, the Harbour
 * compiler and runtime libraries will become a reality very soon.   </par>

 *
 * <b>What this distribution contains</b>   </par>
 * ===============================   </par>
 *
 * This distribution is a Source code only distribution. It does not contain
 * any executable files. Executable versions of Harbour are available from
 * the web site. Executable versions of Harbour DO NOT create runable
 * programs. Harbour at the moment produces C output code, which must be
 * compiled with the Harbour Virtual Machine and the support libraries
 * in order to create a functioning program.   </par>
 * Please test running Harbour against your Clipper source code and report
 * any problems that might occur.    </par>
 *
 * Very important: The preprocessor functionality is not built in yet. So
 * you may test only Clipper language without preprocessor commands, etc.   </par>
 *
 *
 * <b>Installation</b>   </par>
 * ------------   </par>
 *
 * 1. Unzip with Harbour zip file using pkunzip or equivalent.   </par>
 *         E.G. pkunzip -d build72.zip   </par>
 *    This will create Harbour/ directory and all the relevant sub
 *    directories.   </par>
 *
 * 2. Compile Harbour using your C compiler. Make files for different
 *    platforms are included in the <WHERE ARE THEY?> directory.   </par>
