 *      FileSys
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Get the amount of space available on a disk
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      HB_DISKSPACE( [<cDrive>] [, <nType>] ) --> nDiskbytes
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <cDrive> The drive letter you are requesting info on. The default
 *      is A:

 *      <nType> The type of space being requested. The default is HB_DISK_AVAIL.
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      <nDiskBytes> The number of bytes on the requested disk that match the
 *      requested type.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      By default, this function will return the number of bytes of
 *      free space on the current drive that is available to the user
 *      requesting the information.
 *
 *      There are 4 types of information available:
 *
 *       HB_FS_AVAIL    The amount of space available to the user making the
 *                      request. This value could be less than HB_FS_FREE if
 *                      disk quotas are supported by the O/S in use at runtime,
 *                      and disk quotas are in effect. Otherwise, the value
 *                      will be equal to that returned for HB_FS_FREE.
 *
 *       HB_FS_FREE     The actual amount of free diskspace on the drive.
 *
 *       HB_FS_USED     The number of bytes in use on the disk.
 *
 *       HB_FS_TOTAL    The total amount of space allocated for the user if
 *                      disk quotas are in effect, otherwise, the actual size
 *                      of the drive.
 *
 *      If information is requested on a disk that is not available, a runtime
 *      error 2018 will be raised.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      #include "fileio.ch"
 *      ? "You can use : " + hb_ntos( hb_DiskSpace() ) + " bytes " +;
 *        "Out of a total of " + hb_ntos( hb_DiskSpace( "C:", HB_FS_TOTAL ) )
