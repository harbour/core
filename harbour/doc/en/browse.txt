/* TODO: put more comprehensive $EXAMPLES$.
         DBEDIT() is a complex function, the doc I had made cover all the
         parameters but probably not good enough for a new user that does
         not know what this function is all about and how to use it. I am
         not that good with the English language (and I did not want to
         COPY the NG text) I suggest later some one should add to this
         text. [chkedem] */

 *      <acColumns> is an array of character expressions that contain

 *      If not specified, the default is to display all fields from the
 *      database in the current work area.
 *
 *      <xUserFunc> is a name of a user defined function or a code block
 *      that would be called every time unrecognized key is been pressed or
 *      when there are no keys waiting to be processed and DBEDIT() goes
 *      into idle mode. If <xUserFunc> is a character string, it must
 *      contain root name of a valid user define function without
 *      parentheses. Both the user define function or the code block should
 *      accept two parameters: nMode, nCurrentColumn. Both should return
 *      a numeric value that correspond to one of the expected return codes
 *      (see table below for a list of nMode and return codes).
 *
 *      <xColumnSayPictures> is an optional picture. If <xColumnSayPictures>
 *      is a character string, all columns would used this value as a
 *      picture string. If <xColumnSayPictures> is an array, each element
 *      should be a character string that correspond to a picture string
 *      for the column with the same index. Look at the help for @...SAY
 *      to get more information about picture values.
 *
 *      <xColumnHeaders> contain the header titles for each column, if this
 *      is a character string, all columns would have that same header, if
 *      this is an array, each element is a character string that contain
 *      the header title for one column. Header may be split to more than
 *      one line by placing semicolon (;) in places where you want to break
 *      line. If omitted, the default value for each column header is taken
 *      from <acColumns> or field name if <acColumns> was not specified.
 *
 *      <xHeadingSeparators> is an array that contain characters that draw
 *      the lines separating the headers and the fields data. Instead of an
 *      array you can use a character string that would be used to display
 *      the same line for all fields. Default value is a double line.
 *
 *      <xColumnSeparators> is an array that contain characters that draw
 *      the lines separating displayed columns. Instead of an array you can
 *      use a character string that would be used to display the same line
 *      for all fields. Default value is a single line.
 *
 *      <xFootingSeparators> is an array that contain characters that draw
 *      the lines separating the fields data area and the footing area.
 *      Instead of an array you can use a character string that would be
 *      used to display the same line for all footers. Default is to have to
 *      no footing separators.
 *
 *      <xColumnFootings> contain the footing to be displayed at the bottom
 *      of each column, if this is a character string, all columns would
 *      have that same footer, if this is an array, each element is a
 *      character string that contain the footer for one column. Footer may
 *      be split to more than one line by placing semicolon (;) in places
 *      where you want to break line. If omitted, no footer are displayed.
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      DBEDIT() return .F. if there is no database in use or if the number
 *      of columns to display is zero, else DBEDIT() return .T.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      DBEDIT() display and edit records from one or more work areas in
 *      a grid on screen. Each column is defined by element from <acColumns>
 *      and is the equivalent of one field. Each row is equivalent of one
 *      database record.
 *
 *      Following are active keys that handled by DBEDIT():
 *      ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      Left           - Move one column to the left (previous field)
 *      Right          - Move one column to the right (next field)
 *      Up             - Move up one row (previous record)
 *      Down           - Move down one row (next record)
 *      Page-Up        - Move to the previous screen
 *      Page-Down      - Move to the next screen
 *      Ctrl Page-Up   - Move to the top of the file
 *      Ctrl Page-Down - Move to the end of the file
 *      Home           - Move to the leftmost visible column
 *      End            - Move to the rightmost visible column
 *      Ctrl Left      - Pan one column to the left
 *      Ctrl Right     - Pan one column to the right
 *      Ctrl Home      - Move to the leftmost column
 *      Ctrl End       - Move to the rightmost column
 *
 *      When <xUserFunc> is omitted, two more keys are active:
 *
 *      Esc            - Terminate BROWSE()
 *      Enter          - Terminate BROWSE()
 *
 *      When DBEDIT() execute <xUserFunc> it pass the following arguments:
 *      nMode and the index of current record in <acColumns>. If <acColumns>
 *      is omitted, the index number is the FIELD() number of the open
 *      database structure.
 *
 *      DBEDIT() nMode could be one of the following:
 *      ---------------------------------------------
 *
 *      DE_IDLE         0      DBEDIT() is idle, all movement keys have been
 *                             handled.
 *      DE_HITTOP       1      Attempt to cursor past top of file.
 *      DE_HITBOTTOM    2      Attempt to cursor past bottom of file.
 *      DE_EMPTY        3      No records in work area, database is empty.
 *      DE_EXCEPT       4      Key exception.
 *
 *      The user define function or code block must return a value that tell
 *      DBEDIT() what to do next.
 *
 *      User function return codes:
 *      ---------------------------
 *
 *      DE_ABORT        0      Abort DBEDIT().
 *      DE_CONT         1      Continue DBEDIT() as is.
 *      DE_REFRESH      2      Force reread/redisplay of all data rows.
 *
 *      The user function is called once in each of the following cases:
 *      - The database is empty.
 *      - The user try to move past top of file or past bottom file.
 *      - Key exception, the uses had pressed a key that is not handled by
 *        DBEDIT().
 *      - The keyboard buffer is empty or a screen refresh had just occurred
 *
 *      DBEDIT() is a compatibility function, it is superseded by the
 *      TBrowse class and there for not recommended for new applications.

 *      <xUserFunc> can take a code block value, this is a Harbour
 *      extension.
 *
 *      CA-Clipper will throw an error if there's no database open, Harbour
 *      would return .F.
 *
 *      CA-Clipper is buggy and will throw an error if the number of columns
 *      zero, Harbour would return .F.
 *
 *      The CA-Clipper 5.2 NG state that the return value is NIL, this is
 *      wrong and should be read logical.
 *
 *      There is an undocumented result code (3) from the user defined
 *      function in Clipper (both 87 and 5.x). This is an Append Mode which:
 *      "split the screen to allow data to be appended in windowed area".
