 *       Welcome to Harbour
 *       ==================
 *
 *       Clipper is a trademark of Computer Associates and will often be
 *       referred to as CA-Cl*pper within Harbour documents.  Regardless of this
 *       variant, Clipper is recognized as Computer Associates' trademark.
 *
 *       Harbour is a free software compiler for the xBase superset language often
 *       referred to as Clipper (the language that is implemented by the compiler
 *       Clipper). The goal of the Harbour project is to produce a cross platform
 *       CA-Cl*pper compatible compiler.
 *
 *       The Harbour web site is at <URL:http://harbour-project.org/>. If you

 *       ensure that you are using the latest release.
 *
 *       If you have any questions about Harbour please be sure to read the FAQ
 *       <URL:http://harbour-project.org/faq/>. Also, please be sure to read the
 *       documentation that comes with Harbour, you should find it in the same
 *       directory in which you found this file.
 *
 *       If you are reading this file as part of a source distribution of harbour you
 *       probably want to start by reading dirstruc.txt because this is your map to
 *       the harbour source directories.
 *
 *       Harbour is a superset of Clipper and is backwards compatible with nearly
 *       100% of all Clipper 5.2x or 5.3 code. Most Clipper S'87 code will also
 *       compile and run fine, but may require some modifications to run well.
