      HBClass() is used in the creation of all classes
   $SYNTAX$
      oClass := HBClass():New("TMyClass")

        -or-

      HBClass() is usually accessed by defining a class with the commands
      defined in hbclass.h:

        CLASS HBGetList    // Calls HBClass() to create the HBGetList class
           ...
        ENDCLASS
   $ARGUMENTS$

   $RETURNS$
      An instance of the HBClass Class. This special object's :New()
      method can then create the classes you define.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      HBClass is a class that ...
      The class methods are as follows:

        New()                 Create a new instance of the class
   $EXAMPLES$
      FUNCTION TestObject()
         LOCAL oObject

         oObject := HBClass():New( "TMyClass" )
         oObject:End()

      Object Oriented syntax in Harbour is compatible with CA-Cl*pper.

      However CA-Cl*pper only allowed creation of objects from a few standard
      classes, and did not let the programmer create new classes.

      In Harbour, you can create your own classes--complete with
      Methods, Instance Variables, Class Variables and Inheritance.
      Entire applications can be designed and coded in Object Oriented
      style.
