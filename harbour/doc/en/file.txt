      Open a file.

      FOPEN( <cFile>, [<nMode>] ) --> nHandle
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cFile> Name of file to open.

      <nMode> File open mode.
   $RETURNS$
      <nHandle> A file handle.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function opens a file expressed as <cFile> and returns a
      file handle to be used with other low-level file functions. The
      value of <nMode> represents the status of the file to be opened;
      the default value is 0. The file open modes are as follows:

      <table>
       nMode   fileio.ch      Meaning

       0       FO_READ        Read only
       1       FO_WRITE       Write only
       2       FO_READWRITE   Read/write
       16      FO_EXCLUSIVE   Exclusive read only
       32      FO_DENYWRITE   Prevent others from writing
       48      FO_DENYREAD    Deny read only
       64      FO_DENYNONE    Not deny, Let to others Read / Write
       64      FO_SHARED      same as FO_DENYNONE
      </table>

      If there is an error in opening a file, a -1 will be returned by
      the function. Files handles may be in the range of 0 to 65535. The
      status of the SET DEFAULT TO and SET PATH TO commands has no effect
      on this function. Directory names and paths must be specified along
      with the file that is to be opened.

      If an error has occurred, see the returns values from FERROR() for
      possible reasons for the error.

      This function creates a new file with a filename of <cFile>. The

      attribute byte for the file being created by this function.
      The return value will be a file handle that is associated
      with the new file. This number will be between zero to 65,535,

      <nHandle>     File handle

      <cBuffer>  Character expression passed by reference.

      <nBytes>      Number of bytes to read.
   $RETURNS$
      <nBytes> the number of bytes successfully read from the file.
      <nHandle>
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function reads the characters from a file whose file handle
      is <nHandle> into a character memory variable expressed as <cBuffer>.
      The function returns the number of bytes successfully read into
      <cBuffer>.

      The value of <nHandle> is obtained from either a call to the FOPEN()
      or the FCREATE() function.

      The <cBuffer> expression is passed by reference and must be defined
      before this function is called. It also must be at least the same
      length as <nBytes>.

      <nBytes> is the number of bytes to read, starting at the current
      file pointer position. If this function is successful in reading
      the characters from the file, the length of <cBuffer> or the number
      of bytes specified in <nBytes> will be the value returned. The current
      file pointer advances the number of bytes read with each successive
      read. The return value is the number of bytes successfully read
      from the file. If a 0 is returned, or if the number of
      bytes read matches neither the length of <cBuffer> nor the specified
      value in <nBytes> an end-of-file condition has been reached.

      <nBytes>   The number of bytes to write.

      <nBytesWritten> the number of bytes successfully written.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function writes the contents of <cBuffer> to the file designated
      by its file handle <nHandle>. If used, <nBytes> is the number of
      bytes in <cBuffer> to write.

      The returned value is the number of bytes successfully written to the
      file. If the returned value is 0, an error has occurred (unless
      this is intended). A successful write occurs when the number returned
      by FWrite() is equal to either Len( <cBuffer> ) or <nBytes>.

      The value of <cBuffer> is the string or variable to be written to the
      open file <nHandle>.

      The value of <nBytes> is the number of bytes to write out to the file.
      The disk write begins with the current file position in <nHandle>. If
      this variable is not used, the entire contents of <cBuffer> is written
      to the file.
      To truncate a file, a call of FWRITE( nHandle, "", 0 ) is needed.

      or (if none is used) the current drive and directory, the function
      will not execute successfully.

      If the file specified in <cNewFile> exists or the file is open,
      the function will be unable to rename the file. If the function
      is unable to complete its operation,it will return a value of -1.
      If it is able to rename the file, the return value for the function
      will be 0. A call to FERROR() function will give additional infor-

      The value of <nOffSet> is the number of bytes to move the file pointer
      from the position determined by <nOrigin>. The value of <nOffset> may
      be a negative number, suggesting backward movement.
