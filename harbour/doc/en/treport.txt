 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      This command prints out the report named <cReportName>, which is a standard
 *      FRM file. The file extension is not required because FRM will be assumed.
 *      The SET PATH TO and SET DEFAULT TO commands affect the search for the file
 *      <cReportName>; unless a drive and path are specified in <cReportName>, REPORT
 *      will search the path specified in the SET PATH command if it cannot find the
 *      report form in the current directory.   </par>

 *      The output of the report will be offset based on the setting of the SET MARGIN
 *      TO value.   </par>

 *      By default, output will go to the console; however, it may be controlled via
 *      either the TO PRINTER or TO FILE clause. If the output is to go to the file,
 *      the name of the alternate file is specified in <cFile>. Unless specified in
 *      <cFile>, the default file extension will be .TXT .
 *      <cScope> is the scope for this command. Valid scopes include NEXT <expN> (where
 *      <expN> is tile number of records), RECORD <expN> (a specific record to be
 *      displayed), REST (all records from the current record position), and ALL
 *      (all records). The default is ALL.   </par>

 *      Both logical expressions may work in conjuntion with one another, where <bFor>
 *      is the logical expression for the FOR condition (for records to be displayed
 *      within a given range) and <bWhile> for the WHILE condition (for records to be
 *      displayed until the condition fails).    </par>

 *      If the PLAIN clause is specified, date and page numbers are suppressed. In
 *      addition, there is no  automatic page breaking, and the report title and
 *      column headings appear only once at the top of the form.   </par>

 *      If the HEADING clause is used, <cHeading> is displayed on the first title
 *      of each report page. The value of <cHeading> is evaluated only once before
 *      executing the report; varying the values of <cHeading> is not allowed. The
 *      PLAIN clause will take precedence over the HEADING clause if both are included.   </par>

 *      If the NOEJECT clause is used, the initial page eject on the report will not be
 *      issued when the output clause TO PRINTER is specified. Otherwise, this clause has
 *      no effect.   </par>

 *      If the SUMMARY Clause is specified, the report will contain only groups, subgroups,
 *      and grand total information. The detailed title item information will be ignored.   </par>

 *      If the NOCONSOLE clause is specified,output to the console will be turned off
 *      while this command is being executed.   </par>
