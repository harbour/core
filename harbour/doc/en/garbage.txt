 *      The Garbage Collector
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      Document
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Readme for Harbour Garbage Collect Feature
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      The garbage collector uses the following logic:
 *      - first collect all memory allocations that can cause garbage;
 *      - next scan all variables if these memory blocks are still referenced.
 *
 *      Notice that only arrays, objects and codeblocks are collected because
 *      these are the only datatypes that can cause self-references (a[1]:=a)
 *      or circular references (a[1]:=b; b[1]:=c; c[1]:=a) that cannot be
 *      properly deallocated by simple reference counting.
 *
 *      Since all variables in harbour are stored inside some available tables
 *      (the eval stack, memvars table and array of static variables) then checking
 *      if the reference is still alive is quite easy and doesn't require any
 *      special treatment during memory allocation. Additionaly the garbage
 *      collector is scanning some internal data used by harbour objects
 *      implementation that also stores some values that can contain memory
 *      references. These data are used to initialize class instance variables
 *      and are stored in class shared variables.
 *
 *      In special cases when the value of a harbour variable is stored internally
 *      in some static area (at C or assembler level), for example SETKEY()
 *      stores codeblocks that will be evaluated when a key is pressed,
 *      the garbage collector will be not able to scan such values since it
 *      doesn't know their location. This could cause some memory blocks to be
 *      released prematurely. To prevent the premature deallocation of such memory
 *      blocks they have to be locked for the garbage collector. The memory block
 *      can be locked with hb_gcLockItem() (recommendeed method) if
 *      harbour item structure is used or hb_gcLock() function if a direct memory
 *      pointer is used. The memory block can be unlocked by hb_gcUnlockItem() or
 *      hb_gcUnlock().
 *
 *      Notice however that all variables passed to a low level function are
 *      passed via the eval stack, so they don't require locking during the
 *      function call. The locking will be required if a passed value is copied
 *      into some static area to make it available for other low-level functions
 *      called after the exit from function that stored the value. This is required
 *      because the value is removed from the eval stack after the function call and
 *      it can be no longer be referenced by other variables.
 *
 *      However, scanning of all variables can be a time consuming operation. It
 *      requires that all allocated arrays have to be traversed through all their
 *      elements to find more arrays. Also all codeblocks are scanned for detached
 *      local variables they are referencing. For this reason, looking for unreferenced
 *      memory blocks is performed during the idle states.
 *
 *      The idle state is a state when there is no real application code
 *      executed. For example, the user code is stopped for 0.1 of a second
 *      during INKEY(0.1) - Harbour is checking the keyboard only
 *      during this time. It leaves however quite enough time for
 *      many other background tasks. One such background task can be looking
 *      for unreferenced memory blocks.
 *
 *      Allocating memory    </par>
 *      -----------------
 *
 *      The garbage collector collects memory blocks allocated with hb_gcAlloc()
 *      function calls. Memory allocated by hb_gcAlloc() should be released with
 *      hb_gcFree() function.
 *
 *      Locking memory   </par>
 *      --------------
 *
 *      The memory allocated with hb_gcAlloc() should be locked to prevent
 *      automatic releasing if such a memory pointer is not stored within a
 *      harbour level variable. All harbour values (items) stored internally
 *      in static C area have to be locked.
 *      See hb_gcLockItem() and hb_gcUnlockItem() for more information.
 *
 *      The garbage collecting   </par>
 *      ----------------------
 *
 *      During scanning of unreferenced memory the GC is using a mark & sweep
 *      algorithm. This is done in three steps:
 *
 *      1) mark all memory blocks allocated by the GC with unused flag;
 *
 *      2) sweep (scan) all known places and clear unused flag for memory
 *      blocks that are referenced there;
 *
 *      3) finalize collecting by deallocation of all memory blocks that are
 *      still marked as unused and that are not locked.
 *
 *      To speed things up, the mark step is simplified by swapping the meaning
 *      of the unused flag. After deallocation of unused blocks all still alive
 *      memory blocks are marked with the same 'used' flag so we can reverse
 *      the meaning of this flag to 'unused' state in the next collecting.
 *      All new or unlocked memory blocks are automatically marked as 'unused'
 *      using the current flag, which assures that all memory blocks are marked
 *      with the same flag before the sweep step will start.
 *      See hb_gcCollectAll()  and hb_gcItemRef()
 *
 *      Calling the garbage collector from harbour code   </par>
 *      -----------------------------------------------
 *
 *      The garbage collector can be called directly from the harbour code.
 *      This is usefull in situations where there is no idle states available
 *      or the application is working in the loop with no user interaction
 *      and there is many memory allocations.
 *      See HB_GCALL() for explanation of how to call this function from your
 *      harbour code.

 *
 *      <pCleanupFunc> Pointer to HB_GARBAGE_FUNC function that will be called

 *      function should release all other memory allocated and stored inside

 *  $RETURNS$
 *      The pointer to allocated memory or it generates an internal

 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      hb_gcAlloc() is used to allocate the memory that will be tracked
 *      by the garbage collector. It allows to properly release memory
 *      in case of self-referencing or cross-referencing harbour level
 *      variables.
 *      Memory allocated with this function should be released with
 *      hb_gcFree() function or it will be automatically deallocated

 *      harbour level variable.
