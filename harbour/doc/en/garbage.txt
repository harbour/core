      Readme for Harbour Garbage Collect Feature
   $DESCRIPTION$
      The garbage collector uses the following logic:
      - first collect all memory allocations that can cause garbage;
      - next scan all variables if these memory blocks are still referenced.

      Notice that only arrays, objects and codeblocks are collected because
      these are the only datatypes that can cause self-references (a[1]:=a)
      or circular references (a[1]:=b; b[1]:=c; c[1]:=a) that cannot be
      properly deallocated by simple reference counting.

      Since all variables in harbour are stored inside some available tables
      (the eval stack, memvars table and array of static variables) then checking
      if the reference is still alive is quite easy and doesn't require any
      special treatment during memory allocation. Additionaly the garbage
      collector is scanning some internal data used by harbour objects
      implementation that also stores some values that can contain memory
      references. These data are used to initialize class instance variables
      and are stored in class shared variables.

      In special cases when the value of a harbour variable is stored internally
      in some static area (at C or assembler level), the garbage collector will
      be not able to scan such values since it doesn't know their location. This
      could cause some memory blocks to be released prematurely. To prevent the
      premature deallocation of such memory blocks the static data have to store
      a pointer to the value created with hb_itemNew() function.
      Example:
        static HB_ITEM s_item; /* this item can be released by the GC */

        static PHB_ITEM pItem; /* this item will be maintained correctly */
        pItem = hb_itemNew( hb_param( 1, IT_BLOCK ) );

      However, scanning of all variables can be a time consuming operation. It
      requires that all allocated arrays have to be traversed through all their
      elements to find more arrays. Also all codeblocks are scanned for detached
      local variables they are referencing. For this reason, looking for unreferenced
      memory blocks is performed during the idle states.

      The idle state is a state when there is no real application code
      executed. For example, the user code is stopped for 0.1 of a second
      during Inkey(0.1) - Harbour is checking the keyboard only
      during this time. It leaves however quite enough time for
      many other background tasks. One such background task can be looking
      for unreferenced memory blocks.

      Allocating memory    </par>
      -----------------

      The garbage collector collects memory blocks allocated with hb_gcAlloc()
      function calls. Memory allocated by hb_gcAlloc() should be released with
      hb_gcFree() function.

      The garbage collecting   </par>
      ----------------------

      During scanning of unreferenced memory the GC is using a mark & sweep
      algorithm. This is done in three steps:

      1) mark all memory blocks allocated by the GC with unused flag;

      2) sweep (scan) all known places and clear unused flag for memory
      blocks that are referenced there;

      3) finalize collecting by deallocation of all memory blocks that are
      still marked as unused and that are not locked.

      To speed things up, the mark step is simplified by swapping the meaning
      of the unused flag. After deallocation of unused blocks all still alive
      memory blocks are marked with the same 'used' flag so we can reverse
      the meaning of this flag to 'unused' state in the next collecting.
      All new or unlocked memory blocks are automatically marked as 'unused'
      using the current flag, which assures that all memory blocks are marked
      with the same flag before the sweep step will start.
      See hb_gcCollectAll() and hb_gcItemRef()

      Calling the garbage collector from harbour code   </par>
      -----------------------------------------------

      The garbage collector can be called directly from the harbour code.
      This is usefull in situations where there is no idle states available
      or the application is working in the loop with no user interaction
      and there is many memory allocations.
      See hb_gcAll() for explanation of how to call this function from your
      harbour code.

      <ulSize> Requested size of memory block

      <pCleanupFunc> Pointer to HB_GARBAGE_FUNC function that will be called
      directly before releasing the garbage memory block or NULL. This
      function should release all other memory allocated and stored inside
      the memory block. For example, it releases all items stored inside
      the array. The functions receives a single parameter: the pointer
      to memory allocated by hb_gcAlloc().
   $RETURNS$
      The pointer to allocated memory or it generates an internal
      unrecoverable error.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      hb_gcAlloc() is used to allocate the memory that will be tracked
      by the garbage collector. It allows to properly release memory
      in case of self-referencing or cross-referencing harbour level
      variables.
      Memory allocated with this function should be released with
      hb_gcFree() function or it will be automatically deallocated
      by the GC if it is not locked or if it is not referenced by some
      harbour level variable.

      <pItem>  The pointer to item structure that will be scanned. The

      and codeblocks are scanned only. Other datatypes don't require
      locking so they are simply ignored.
   $RETURNS$
      Nothing.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      The garbage collector uses hb_gcItemRef() function during
      scanning of referenced memory pointers. This function checks the
      type of passed item and scans recursively all other memory blocks
      referenced by this item if it is an array, an object or a codeblock.

      NOTE: This function is reserved for the garbage collector only. It
            cannot be called from the user code - calling it can cause
            unpredicted results (memory blocks referenced by the
            passed item can be released prematurely during the closest
            garbage collection).
