      <b>Language extensions:</b>   </par>
      --------------------
  
      * Class generation and management.
  
              CA-Cl*pper only allowed creation of objects from a few standard
              classes.
  
              In Harbour, you can create your own classes--complete with
              Methods, Instance Variables, Class Variables and Inheritance.
              Entire applications can be designed and coded in Object Oriented
              style.
  
      * @<FunctionName>()   </par>
  
              Returns the pointer (address) to a function.
  
              The returned value is not useful to application-level programming, but
              is used at a low level to implement object oriented coding.
              (Internally, a class method is a static function and there is no
              symbol for it, so it is accessed via its address).
  
      * Class HBGetList
  
              Object oriented support for GetLists management.
  
      * ProcName() support for class Method names.
  
              Class Methods can be retrieved from the call stack.
  
      * Memory() has new return values.
  
              See hbmemory.ch
  
      * Transform()  --> new function in format string
  
              @0      Make a zero padded string out of the number.
  
      * SToD()  --> dDate
  
              New function that converts a yyyymmdd string to a Date value.
  
      * Optional Compile Time STRONG TYPE declaration (and compile time TYPE
        MISMATCH warnings)
  
        Example: LOCAL/STATIC Var AS ...
  
      * The Harbour debugger provides new interesting classes:
  
        - Class TDbWindow could be the foundation for a generic multiplatform
  
        - Class TForm
  
        - Class TDbMenu implement both pulldown and popup menus.
  
      <b>RTL enhanced functionality:</b>   </par>
      ---------------------------
  
      - Directory( <cMask>, <cFlags>, <lEightDotThree> )
  
        The 3rd parameter is a Harbour (optional) parameter and indicates that on
        those platforms that support long filenames, that you wish to receive what
        would be considered the dos equivalant 8.3 name.
        Could affect Adir() and Dir if they were modified to take advantage
        of it - currently, they will return long names if the os supports it.
  
      - HB_DiskSpace( <nDrive>, <nType> )
  
        The second parameter is a Harbour (optional) parameter and indicates the
        type of diskinfo being requested.  See en/diskspac.txt for info.
