INTRODUCTION
============

This file explains the philosophy for the GNU-make based build system
for Harbour, and gives instructions on how to use it.


PHILOSOPHY
==========

This build system is based on GNU-make, the idea being that GNU-make
is freely available for every platform you can dream up, and it is
usually more powerful than any native make.

Each directory in the project contains one makefile, called Makefile,
which lists the data (file names, directory names, etc.) that is used
to determine how to bring every target up to date within that
directory. There are no rules in the Makefiles, to keep them
platform-independent. The rules themselves are included from the
"appropriate" configuration file.

For example, the following was the Makefile for an early version
of the VM library:

--  Cut here  ---------------------------------------
#
# $Id$
#

ROOT := ../../

C_SOURCES := \
        dynsym.c \
        hvm.c \
        initsymb.c \

LIB := vm

include $(TOP)$(ROOT)config/lib.mk
--  Cut here  ---------------------------------------

What this means is:

* The root of the source directory is in ../../; that is where the
  config/ directory lives, with all the real rules to make the
  targets.
* The only sources in this directory are C sources (three files).
* The library name is "vm". This will be translated to a real file
  name depending on the rules file: "libvm.a" on Unix, "vm.lib" on
  Windows.
* The final line includes the rules file. In this case, we include a
  set of rules to build a library.

Let's look at another Makefile, this one for the Harbour compiler:

--  Cut here  ---------------------------------------
#
# $Id$
#

ROOT := ../../

YACC_SOURCE := harbour.y

LEX_SOURCE := harbour.l

C_SOURCES := \
        genobj32.c \

C_MAIN=harbour.c

include $(TOP)$(ROOT)config/bin.mk
--  Cut here  ---------------------------------------

Notice how we now have other kinds of source files: yacc sources and
lex sources. Also, since this is a Makefile for a stand-alone
executable, we indicate the name for the file containing the "main"
function, which also defines the executable name. The rules included
in this Makefile are those appropriate to build a stand-alone binary.

One final Makefile, this one from the source directory:

#
# $Id$
#

--  Cut here  ---------------------------------------
ROOT := ../

DIRS := \
        compiler \
        hbpp \
        rtl \
        vm \
        rdd \
        tools \

include $(TOP)$(ROOT)config/dir.mk
--  Cut here  ---------------------------------------

This Makefile is used to traverse the subdirectories hanging from the
current directory. It simply lists all the subdirectories to be
traversed.

Now. let's take a look at the rules themselves. They all live in the
config/ directory, with the following structure:

  config/: The generic configuration files.
  config/win: Configuration files for Windows platforms.


Finally, you will notice one thing: the build system compiles
everything into a subdirectory (for example, win/gcc for Windows
files compiled with gcc). This has two advantages:

1. It allows you to compile for multiple platforms/compilers at the
   same time.
2. It creates all temporary, object, binary, intermediate, etc. files
   in the subdirectory; cleaning up is very easy.


USAGE
=====

To use the system, you need to install GNU-make 3.81 or later on your
system. To check this, type "make -v"; you should see

  GNU Make 3.81
  Copyright (C) 2006  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  ...

Then, you must set a couple of environment variables that indicate
your platform and compiler.

For gcc on Win95/WinNT with the Cygwin library:
  Notes: The CYGWIN environment variable must include "noglob" in order
         to avoid having Harbour or programs created with Harbour expand
         wildcard command line arguments (this is checked at run-time!)
  HB_PLATFORM       win
  HB_COMPILER       gcc
  CYGWIN            noglob

For gcc on Win95/WinNT with the MinGW library:
  HB_PLATFORM       win
  HB_COMPILER       mingw

For MSVC on Win95/WinNT:
  Notes: gnu make is case sensitive!  If your editor converts
         harbour.c to HARBOUR.C when it saves the file, then gnu make
         _will_not_work.
         If you have MAKE_MODE in your dos environment, make sure it is
         not set to unix

         For best results, also set:
  HB_PLATFORM       win
  HB_COMPILER       msvc

For GCC on BSD:
  HB_PLATFORM       bsd
  HB_COMPILER       gcc
  Notes:
    1)  You have to have bison and gmake installed in order to build
        Harbour for BSD. The file doc/howtobsd.txt gives an overview
        of what is required.

For GCC on Linux:
  HB_PLATFORM       linux
  HB_COMPILER       gcc
  Notes:
    1)  If you want to take advantage of compiler cache programs
        (such as http://ccaache.samba.org), you may set environment
        variable HB_CCACHE with the value containing the name of program.

For GCC on OS/2 for VIO mode:
  Note: You must point C_INCLUDE_PATH to the EMX include directory and
        you must also point LIBRARY_PATH to the EMX library directory.
  HB_PLATFORM       os2
  HB_COMPILER       gcc

For Borland C++
  HB_PLATFORM       win
  HB_COMPILER       bcc

For DJGPP (GCC port for MS-DOS)
  HB_PLATFORM       dos
  HB_COMPILER       djgpp

For Watcom C/C++ 10.x (default Makefile creates DOS4G extender executables)
  HB_PLATFORM       dos
  HB_COMPILER       watcom

The most used targets are these:

* all: Same as typing "make" without arguments. It will usually try to
  compile and link the obvious target in the directory.

* clean: Clean up everything made by make.

* install: Install stuff into the appropriate directories.


NOTES
=====

See README.txt about details.


You can build and/or run any program in tests/working by using hbmk2
and hbrun. For example, 'hbmk2 scroll.prg -run' will build the scroll.prg
program and then run it. 'hbrun scroll.prg' will run the program as
a script. You can also pass parameters to the program. For example,
'hbrun readfile.prg harbour.ini' will rebuild the readfile.prg program
and run it with 'harbour.ini' as a command line parameter.
