How to create and test the Harbour Guestbook

You'll find guestbk.prg and guestbk.html files.
To build the executable, review guestbk.prg and
check the directories for locating guestbk.ini
and guestbk.html correctly.

With that done, build it using hbmk2. Put the resulting
executable and .html files on a script-enabled directory
and call guestbk executable via WebBrowser.

The best thing about this guestbook is its highly
configurable architecture. Please review guestbk.ini
for configuration options and further explanation.

That's it!

PS: If you don't have a WebServer, I will be pleased to
demonstrate it to you. Just contact me via ICQ, my
