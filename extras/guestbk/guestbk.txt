How to create and test the Harbour Guestbook

You'll find guestbk.prg and guestbk.htm files.
To build the executable, review guestbk.prg and
check the directories for locating guestbk.ini
and guestbk.htm correctly.

With that done, build it using hbmk2. Put the
resulting .exe, the .exe and .htm files on a script-
enabled directory and call guestbk.exe via WebBrowser.

The best thing about this guestbook is its highly
configurable architecture. Please review guestbk.ini
for configuration options and further explanation.

That's it!

PS: If you don't have a WebServer, I will be pleased to
demonstrate it to you. Just contact me via ICQ, my
