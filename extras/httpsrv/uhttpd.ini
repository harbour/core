# --- console display rows
#Console-rows     = 25

# --- console display cols
#Console-cols     = 80

# --- application directory - macro $(APP_DIR) is application folder
#application_root = $(APP_DIR)

# --- document folder - macro $(APP_DIR) will be substitute with application_root
#document_root    = $(APP_DIR)\home

# --- display folder content

[THREADS]
# --- how much a thread has to wait a connection before quit

# --- how many threads have to run always
#start_num = 4

# --- how many threads can be added to initial threads
#     (over this number server replies with BUSY error)

[LOGFILES]
# --- path for access log
#     $(APP_DIR)     = to refer to application_root path

# --- path for error log

[SCRIPTALIASES]
# --- here put script aliases to real path
#     you can use following macros:
#     $(DOCROOT_DIR) = to refer to document_root path
#     $(APP_DIR)     = to refer to application_root path
#     otherwise it will be a full filesystem path
/info   = $(DOCROOT_DIR)/cgi-bin/info.hrb
/cookie = $(DOCROOT_DIR)/cgi-bin/cookie.hrb

[ALIASES]
# --- here put path aliases to real path
#     you can use following macros:
#     $(DOCROOT_DIR) = to refer to document_root path
#     $(APP_DIR)     = to refer to application_root path
#     otherwise it will be a full filesystem path
# example:
#/images = $(APP_DIR)/images
