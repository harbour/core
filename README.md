Harbour is the free software implementation of a multi-platform,
multi-threading, object-oriented, scriptable programming language,
backward compatible with xBase languages. Harbour consists of
a compiler and runtime libraries with multiple UI and database
backends, its own make system and a large collection of libraries
and interfaces to popular APIs.

# How to Build

For all platforms you will need:

* Supported ANSI C compiler
* GNU Make (3.81 recommended, minimum 3.79 required, see also platform details)
* Harbour sources (2.0.0 or upper)

## on Windows hosts (possible cross-build targets: Windows CE, MS-DOS, OS/2, Linux)

Platform specific prerequisites:

1. Windows 7 or upper system is recommended to *build* Harbour.
2. Make sure to have your C compiler of choice installed
   in `PATH`. Refer to your C compiler installation and setup
   instructions for details. Make sure no tools in your `PATH`
   belonging to other C compilers are interfering with
   your setup. Also avoid to keep multiple copies of the same
   compiler, or different versions of the same compiler in
   `PATH` at the same time. For the list of supported compilers,
   look up [Supported Platforms and C Compilers](#supported-platforms-and-c-compilers).
3. GNU Make 3.81 or upper is required. A copy of this tool
   is included in the source package, so you don't have to do
   anything.
   If you want to get it separately, you can find it [here](#external-links).
   Unpack it to your `PATH` or Harbour source root directory,
   and run it as `mingw32-make`.

To build:

    > win-make

To test it, type:

    > cd tests
    > ..\bin\<plat>\<comp>\hbmk2 hello.prg
    > hello

You should see `Hello, world!` on screen.

## on Windows hosts with POSIX shells (MSYS/Cygwin)

> Though you can use these alternative shells to build Harbour on Windows,
> it's recommended to use the native one.

To build:

    > sh -c make

To test it, type:

    > cd tests
    > ..\bin\<plat>\<comp>\hbmk2 hello.prg
    > hello

You should see `Hello, world!` on screen.

> When building for Borland C++ make sure that GNU Make
> is executed when typing `make`, Borland Make has the same name.

## on MS-DOS hosts (possible cross-build targets: Windows, OS/2, Linux)

Make sure to have your C compiler of choice installed in `PATH`.

To build:

    > dos-make

To test it, type:

    > cd tests
    > ..\bin\<plat>\<comp>\hbmk2 hello.prg
    > hello

You should see `Hello, world!` on screen.

## on OS/2 hosts (possible cross-build targets: MS-DOS, OS/2, Linux)

To build:

    > os2-make

To test it, type:

    > cd tests
    > ..\bin\<plat>\<comp>\hbmk2 hello.prg
    > hello

You should see `Hello, world!` on screen.

## on Linux hosts (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS, OS/2)

To build:

    $ make [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

To test it, type:

    $ cd tests
    $ ../bin/<plat>/<comp>/hbmk2 hello.prg
    $ ./hello

You should see `Hello, world!` on screen.

## on Darwin (Mac) hosts (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS)

Platform specific prerequisite:
   Xcode or Command Line Tools for Xcode installed

To build:

    $ make [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

To test it, type:

    $ cd tests
    $ ../bin/<plat>/<comp>/hbmk2 hello.prg
    $ ./hello

You should see `Hello, world!` on screen.

> You can override default (host) architecture by adding
> values below to `HB_USER_CFLAGS`, `HB_USER_LDFLAGS` envvars,
> you can use multiple values:<br />
> <br />
> Intel 32-bit: `-arch i386`<br />
> Intel 64-bit: `-arch x86_64`<br />

## on FreeBSD hosts

Platform specific prerequisites:

1. You will need to have the developer tools installed.
2. Then you will need to install gmake and optionally bison.
   If you installed the ports collection, then all you need
   to do to install bison and gmake is to run the following
   commands, which may require that you run su root first to
   get the correct permissions:

        $ cd /usr/ports/devel/gmake
        $ make
        $ make install
        $ make clean
        $ cd /usr/ports/devel/bison
        $ make
        $ make install
        $ make clean

To build:

    $ gmake

To test it, type:

    $ cd tests
    $ ../bin/<plat>/<comp>/hbmk2 hello.prg
    $ ./hello

You should see `Hello, world!` on screen.

## on Minix hosts

Install GNU make from the Minix pkgsrc repository; for details see [here](http://wiki.minix3.org/en/UsersGuide/InstallingBinaryPackages).

Optionally, GCC may also be installed if you wish to use that instead
of Clang, the Minix system compiler.

## on other \*nix hosts (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS)

To build:

    $ gmake [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

Or

    $ make [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

To test it, type:

    $ cd tests
    $ ../bin/<plat>/<comp>/hbmk2 hello.prg
    $ ./hello

You should see `Hello, world!` on screen.

> For sunpro on Solaris:<br />
> If you have any GNU binutils stuff installed, do make sure
> `/usr/ccs/bin` (the location of the native Sun C compilation
> system tools) come *before* the GNU binutils components in
> your `$PATH`.


# How to Do a Partial Build

If you want to build only a specific part of Harbour, like
one core library or all core libraries, or all contrib packages,
you have to do everything the same way as for a full build, the
only difference is that you first have to go into the specific
source directory you'd like to build. When starting GNU Make,
all components under that directory will be built:

    cd src/rtl
    <make> [clean]

If you want to rebuild one specific contrib package, use this:

    cd contrib
    hbmk2 make.hb <name> [clean] [custom hbmk2 options]


# How to Create Packages for Distribution

## Source .tgz on \*nix

    $ package/mpkg_src.sh

## Binary .tgz on \*nix

    $ export HB_BUILD_PKG=yes
    $ make clean install

## Binary .deb on Linux

    $ fakeroot debian/rules binary

## Binary .rpm on Linux

    $ package/mpkg_rpm.sh

You can fine-tune the build with these options:

    --with static      - link all binaries with static libs
    --with localzlib   - build local copy of zlib library
    --with localpcre2  - build local copy of pcre2 library
    --with localpcre   - build local copy of pcre library
    --without x11      - do not build components dependent on x11 (gtxwc)
    --without curses   - do not build components dependent on curses (gtcrs)
    --without slang    - do not build components dependent on slang (gtsln)
    --without gpllib   - do not build components dependent on GPL 3rd party code
    --without gpm      - build components without gpm support (gttrm, gtsln, gtcrs)

## Binary .rpm on Linux (cross-builds)

### for Windows:

    $ package/mpkg_rpm_win.sh

### for Windows CE:

    $ package/mpkg_rpm_wce.sh

## Binary .7z archive on Windows for all targets (except Linux)

    $ set HB_DIR_7Z=C:\7-zip\
    $ set HB_BUILD_PKG=yes

Then run build as usual with `clean install` options.
See: [How to Build](#how-to-build)

## Binary .7z.exe installer for Windows

    $ package\mpkg_win.bat

> Read in-file instructions and do the necessary
> steps before calling the script.


# How to Enable Optional Components

Certain Harbour parts &ndash; typically contrib packages &ndash; depend
on 3rd party components. To make these Harbour parts built, you need
to tell Harbour where to find the headers for these 3rd party
components.

On \*nix systems most of these 3rd party components will
automatically be used if installed on well-known standard
system locations.

You only need to use manual setup if the dependency isn't available
on your platform on a system location, or you wish to use
a non-standard location. Typically, you need to do this on non-\*nix
(Windows, MS-DOS, OS/2) systems for all packages and for a few packages
on \*nix which are not available through official package managers
(f.e. ADS Client).

Note that Harbour is tuned to use 3rd party **binary** packages in their
default, unmodified &ndash; "vanilla" &ndash; install layout created by their
official/mainstream install kits. If you manually move, rename,
delete, add files under the 3rd party packages' root directory, or
use a source package, the default Harbour build process (especially
Windows implib generation) might not work as expected.

You can set these environment variables before starting
the build. Make sure to adjust them to your own directories:

    HB_WITH_CURSES= (on *nix systems and DJGPP, auto-detected on both)
    HB_WITH_GPM= (on Linux only)
    HB_WITH_JPEG=C:\jpeglib (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
    HB_WITH_PCRE2=C:\pcre2
    HB_WITH_PCRE=C:\pcre (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
    HB_WITH_PNG=C:\libpng (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
    HB_WITH_SLANG= (on *nix systems)
    HB_WITH_TIFF=C:\libtiff (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
    HB_WITH_WATT= (on MS-DOS systems)
    HB_WITH_X11= (on *nix systems)
    HB_WITH_ZLIB=C:\zlib (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)

To explicitly disable any given components, use the value `no`.
This may be useful to avoid auto-detection of installed packages
on \*nix systems. You may also use the value `local` to force using the
locally hosted copy (inside Harbour source repository) of these packages,
where applicable. `nolocal` will explicitly disable using locally hosted
copy.

See contrib-specific dependencies and build notes in the projects'
`.hbp` file and find occasional link notes inside their `.hbc` files.

## OpenSolaris

    $ pkg install SUNWgit SUNWgcc SUNWgmake

## FreeBSD

If you want to use the gtsln library instead of gtstd or gtcrs,
then you also need to install libslang. If you installed the ports
collection, then all you need to do to install libslang is to run
the following commands, which may require that you run su first to
get the correct permissions:

    $ cd /usr/ports/devel/libslang
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ make clean


# Build Options

You can fine-tune Harbour builds with below listed
environment variables. You can add most of these via the
GNU Make command-line also, using `make VARNAME=value` syntax.
All of these settings are optional and all settings are
case-sensitive.

## General

   - `HB_INSTALL_PREFIX`

     Target root directory to install Harbour files.
     On \*nix systems the default is set to `/usr/local/`
     or `$(PREFIX)` if specified, and
     `/usr/local/harbour-<arch>-<comp>` for cross-builds.
     It's always set to `./pkg/<arch>/<comp>` when
     `HB_BUILD_PKG` is set to `yes`. On non-\*nix systems,
     you must set it to a valid directory when using
     `install`. Use absolute paths only.
     You have to use path format native to your shell.
     F.e. to specify `C:\dir` on Windows, with Cygwin
     you should use `/cygdrive/c/dir`, with MSYS `/c/dir`.

   - `HB_USER_PRGFLAGS`        User Harbour compiler options
   - `HB_USER_CFLAGS`          User C compiler options
   - `HB_USER_RESFLAGS`        User resource compiler options (on win, wce, os2)
   - `HB_USER_LDFLAGS`         User linker options for executables
   - `HB_USER_AFLAGS`          User linker options for libraries
   - `HB_USER_DFLAGS`          User linker options for dynamic libraries

   Set these only if auto-detection doesn't suit your purpose:

   - `HB_PLATFORM`             Override platform auto-detection
   - `HB_COMPILER`             Override C compiler auto-detection

     See this for possible values:
     [Supported Platforms and C Compilers](#supported-platforms-and-c-compilers)
     See also: `HB_CC*` settings.

## Special

   - `HB_BUILD_DYN=no`

     Create Harbour dynamic libraries. Default: `yes`

   - `HB_BUILD_CONTRIB_DYN=yes`

     Create contrib dynamic libraries. Default: `no`,
     except Windows platform, where it's `yes`.

   - `HB_BUILD_PKG=yes`

     Create release package. Default: `no`
     Requires `clean install` in root source dir.

   - `HB_BUILD_SHARED=yes`

     Create Harbour executables in shared mode.
     Default: `yes` when `HB_INSTALL_PREFIX` points
     to a \*nix system location, otherwise `no`.

   - `HB_BUILD_DEBUG=yes`

     Create debug build. Default: `no`

   - `HB_BUILD_STRIP=[all|bin|lib|no]`

     Strip symbols and debug information from binaries.
     Default: `no`

   - `HB_BUILD_OPTIM=no`

     Enable C compiler optimizations. Default: `yes`

   - `HB_BUILD_MODE=[cpp|c]`

     Change default build mode to C++ or C.
     Default: `c`, except for msvc* compilers, where it's `cpp`.

   - `HB_BUILD_PARTS=[all|compiler|lib]`

     Build only specific part of Harbour.

   - `HB_BUILD_NOGPLLIB=yes`

     Disable components dependent on GPL 3rd party code,
     to allow Harbour for commercial (closed source)
     projects. Default: `no`

   - `HB_BUILD_3RDEXT=no`

     Enable auto-detection of 3rd party components
     on default system locations. Default: `yes`

   - `HB_BUILD_CONTRIBS=no [<l>]`

     Do not build any, or space separated `<l>` list of,
     contrib packages. Please note it will not prevent
     building packages which are dependencies of
     other &ndash; enabled &ndash; packages.

   - `HB_BUILD_CONTRIBS=[<l>]`

     Build space separated `<l>` list of contrib
     libraries. Build all if left empty (default).

   - `HB_BUILD_ADDONS=<l>`

     Build space separated <l> list of additional `.hbp`
     projects.

   - `HB_BUILD_NAME=[<name>]`

     Create named build. This allows keeping multiple builds in parallel for any
     given platform/compiler. F.e. debug / release.

     > In current implementation it's appended to compiler directory name, so
     > all filesystem/platform name rules and limits apply. (Back)slashes will be
     > stripped from the name though.

   - `HB_USER_LIBS=[<list>]`

     Add space separated `<list>` of libs to link process.
     Lib names should be without extension and path.
     You only need this in special cases, like CodeGuard
     build with win/bcc.

   - `HB_INSTALL_IMPLIB=no`

     Copy import libraries created for external .dll
     dependencies to the library install directory in
     `install` build phase. Default: `yes`<br />
     For Windows and OS/2 targets only. Please note
     that this feature doesn't work with all possible
     binary distributions of 3rd party packages.
     We test only the official/mainstream ones. Also
     note that the generated implibs will require .dlls
     compatible with the ones used at build time.

   - `HB_INSTALL_3RDDYN=yes`

     Copy dynamic libraries of external .dll dependencies
     to the dynamic library directory in `install` build
     phase. Default: `no`

   - `HB_SRC_ROOTPATH=<dir>`

     When using GNU Make older than 3.81, you shall set
     the root directory of Harbour source tree as an
     absolute path. If not set, some build functionality
     may fail, like detection of 3rd party packages with
     locally hosted sources.
     With newer make versions, this variable is ignored.

   - `HB_REBUILD_EXTERN=yes`

     Rebuild extern headers. It is meant for developers
     doing Harbour code modifications and releases.
     Default: `no`

   - `HB_REBUILD_PARSER=yes`

     Rebuild language parser sources. You only need this
     if your are Harbour core developer modifying grammar
     rules (.y). Requires GNU Bison 1.28 or upper in `PATH`.
     Default: `no`

   - `HB_CCPATH=[<dir>/]`

     Used with non-\*nix gcc family compilers (and
     sunpro) to specify path to compiler/linker/archive
     tool to help them run from \*nix hosts as cross-build
     tools. Ending slash must be added.

   - `HB_CCPREFIX=[<prefix>]`

     Used with gcc compiler family to specify
     compiler/linker/archive tool name prefix.

   - `HB_CCSUFFIX=[<suffix>]`

     Used with gcc compiler family to specify
     compiler/linker tool name suffix &ndash; usually
     version number.

   - `HB_BUILD_POSTRUN=[<l>]`

     Run space separated `<l>` list of Harbour
     commands after successfully finishing a non-cross
     build. Commands will be run in the target binary
     directory.

## Cross-builds

You can build Harbour for target platforms different from host
platform. F.e. you can create Windows build on \*nix systems, Linux
builds on Windows systems, etc. It's also possible to build targets
for different from host CPU architectures. F.e. you can create
Windows 64-bit build on 32-bit Windows platform, or Linux x86-64
build on x86 hosts, or Linux MIPS build on x86 host, etc.

Point this envvar to the directory where native Harbour executables
for your host platform can be found:

      HB_HOST_BIN=<path-to-harbour-native-build>\bin

If you leave this value empty, the make system will try to auto-detect it,
so in practice all you have to do is to create a native build first (no
`install` required), then create the cross-build. If you set this value
manually, it may be useful to know that `harbour`, `hbpp` and `hbmk2`
executables are required for a cross-build process to succeed.

## on Windows x86-64 (64-bit) hosts

Same as 32-bit Windows, with the difference that you will have to change
`%ProgramFiles%` to `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` for 32-bit and mixed tools,
that you can build for both x86 and x86-64 without building a native
target first, and potential differences with some compilers in using
native binaries if they are available.

# Build Your Own Harbour App

For all platforms you will need two things:

* Harbour binaries

    Either a Harbour binary distribution or a local Harbour
    build will be okay. If you're reading this text, it's
    likely you have one of these already.

* Supported ANSI C compiler

    Your compiler of choice has to be placed in the `PATH` &ndash; and
    configured appropriately according to instructions.
    If you use official Harbour binary distribution on Windows,
    you already have MinGW compiler embedded in the installation,
    which will automatically be used, so you don't have to
    make any extra steps here.

Use `hbmk2` to build your app from source. It's recommended to put
it in the `PATH` (f.e. by using `set PATH=C:\hb\bin;%PATH%` on Windows).

See `hbmk2` [documentation, with examples](utils/hbmk2/doc/hbmk2.en.md).


# Debugging Options

## Tracing

Build Harbour with:

    HB_BUILD_DEBUG=yes

Run app with:

    HB_TR_LEVEL=debug
    # to override default stderr output:
    HB_TR_OUTPUT=<filename>
    # to enable additional system specific logging output,
    # OutputDebugString() on Windows, syslog() on *nix systems:
    HB_TR_SYSOUT=yes

## Memory statistics/tracking

Build Harbour with:

    HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_FM_STATISTICS

## Valgrind (on linux and darwin targets)

Build Harbour with:

    HB_BUILD_DEBUG=yes

Build app with:

    $ hbmk2 myapp -debug

Run app with:

    $ valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --num-callers=16 -v ./myapp 2> myapp.log

## CodeGuard (on win/bcc target only)

Build Harbour with:

    HB_USER_CFLAGS=-vG
    HB_USER_LIBS=cg32

## Harbour Debugger

Build app with:

    $ hbmk2 myapp -b -run

or run script with:

    $ hbrun myapp --hb:debug

Press `<Alt+D>` in the app.
